		text = "[i]The Lament of Oddrun[/i]\n\nINTRODUCTORY NOTE\n\nThe [i]Oddrunargratr[/i] follows [i]Guthrunarkvitha III[/i] in the [i]Codex Regius[/i]; it is not quoted or mentioned elsewhere, except that the composer of the \"short\" Sigurth lay seems to have been familiar with it. The [i]Volsungasaga[/i] says nothing of the story on which it is based, and mentions Oddrun only once, in the course of its paraphrase of Brynhild's prophecy from the \"short\" Sigurth lay. That the poem comes from the eleventh century is generally agreed; prior to the year 1000 there is no trace of the figure of Oddrun, Atli's sister, and yet the [i]Oddrunargratr[/i] is almost certainly older than the \"short\" Sigurth lay, so that the last half of the eleventh century seems to be a fairly safe guess.\n\nWhere or how the figure of Oddrun entered the Sigurth-Atli cycle is uncertain. She does not appear in any of the extant German versions, and it is generally assumed that she was a creation of the North, though the poet refers to \"old tales\" concerning her. She does not directly affect the course of the story at all, though the poet has used effectively the episode of Gunnar's death, with the implication that Atli's vengeance on Gunnar and Hogni was due, at least in part, to his discovery of Gunnar's love affair with Oddrun. The material which forms the background of Oddrun's story belongs wholly to the German part of the legend (cf. introductory note to [i]Gripisspo[/i]), and is paralleled with considerable closeness in the [i]Nibelungenlied[/i]; only Oddrun herself and the subsidiary figures of Borgny and Vilmund are Northern additions. The geography, on the other hand, is so utterly chaotic as to indicate that the original localization of the Atli story had lost all trace of significance by the time this poem was composed.\n\nIn the manuscript the poem, or rather the brief introductory prose note, bears the heading \"Of Borgny and Oddrun,\" but nearly all editions, following late paper manuscripts, have given the poem the title it bears here. Outside of a few apparently defective stanzas, and some confusing transpositions, the Poem has clearly been preserved in good condition, and the beginning and end are definitely marked."

		text = "__________________\n\nHeithrek was the name of a king, whose daughter was called Borgny. Vilmund was the name of the man who was her lover. She could not give birth to a child until Oddrun, Atli's sister, had come to her; Oddrun had been beloved of Gunnar, son of Gjuki. About this story is the following poem.\n\n1. I have heard it told | in olden tales\nHow a maiden came | to Morningland;\nNo one of all | on earth above\nTo Heithrek's daughter | help could give.\n\n2. This Oddrun learned, | the sister of Atli,\nThat sore the maiden's | sickness was;\nThe bit-bearer forth | from his stall she brought,\nAnd the saddle laid | on the steed so black.\n\n3. She let the horse go | o'er the level ground,\nTill she reached the hall | that loftily rose,\n\n[[i]Prose[/i]. Nothing further is known of [i]Heithrek[/i], [i]Borgny[/i] or [i]Vilmund[/i]. The annotator has added the name of Borgny's father, but otherwise his material comes from the poem itself. [i]Oddrun[/i], sister of Atli and Brynhild, here appears as proficient in birth runes (cf. [i]Sigrdrifumol[/i], 8). Regarding her love for Gunnar, Guthrun's brother, and husband of her sister, Brynhild, cf. [i]Sigurtharkvitha en skamma[/i], 57 and note.\n\n1. [i]Olden tales[/i]: this may be merely a stock phrase, or it may really mean that the poet found his story in oral prose tradition. [i]Morningland[/i]: the poem's geography is utterly obscure. \"Morningland\" is apparently identical with \"Hunland\" (stanza 4), and yet Oddrun is herself sister of the king of the Huns. Vigfusson tries to make \"Mornaland\" into \"Morva land\" and explain it as Moravia. Probably it means little more than a country lying vaguely in the East. With stanza 28 the confusion grows worse.]"

'Who worked this woe | for the woman thus,\nOr why so sudden | is Borgny sick?\"\n\n[i]The serving-maid spake:[/i]\n\"Vilmund is he, | the heroes' friend,\nWho wrapped the woman | in bedclothes warm,\n(For winters five, | yet her father knew not).\"\n\n6. Then no more | they spake, methinks;\nShe went at the knees | of the woman to sit;\n\n[3. Line 3 (cf. [i]Völundarkvitha[/i], 17) or line 5 (cf. [i]Thrymskvitha[/i], 2), both quoted from older poems, is probably spurious; the manuscript marks line 3 as the beginning of a new stanza.\n\n4. Line 1 in the original appears to have lost its second half. In line 2 the word rendered \"has happened\" is doubtful. The manuscript does not indicate the speaker of lines 3-4, and a few editors assign them to Borgny herself.\n\n5. The manuscript does not indicate the speakers. [i]For the woman[/i]: conjectural; the manuscript has instead: \"What warrior now hath worked this woe?\" The manuscript indicates line 3 as beginning a new stanza. Line 5, apparently modeled on line, 4 of stanza n, is probably spurious.]"

Charms: cf. [i]Sigrdrifumol[/i], 8.\n\n7. [i]Hogni's slayer[/i]: obviously Vilmund, but unless he was the one of Atli's followers who actually cut out Hogni's heart (cf. [i]Drap Niflunga[/i]), there is nothing else to connect him with Hogni's death. Sijmons emends the line to read \"Born of the sister | of Hogni's slayer.\"'\n\n8. Regarding [i]Frigg[/i] as a goddess of healing cf. [i]Svipdagsmol[/i], 52, note. Regarding [i]Freyja[/i] as the friend of lovers cf. [i]Grimnismol[/i], 14, note. A line is very possibly missing from this stanza.\n\n9. The manuscript does not name the speaker. In line 2 the word rendered \"earn\" is omitted in the manuscript, but nearly all editions have supplied it. Line 5 is clearly either interpolated or out of place. It may be all that is left of a stanza which stood between stanzas 15 and 16, or it may belong in stanza 12.]"

The changes made here, following several of the editions, are: (a) the transposition of stanzas 10-11, which are clearly dialogue, out of the body of the lament to a position just before it; (b) the transposition of lines 1-2 of stanza 15 to their present position from the middle of stanza 19.\n\n10. The manuscript does not name the speaker; cf. note on stanzas 10-20.\n\n11. The manuscript does not name the speaker; cf. note on stanzas 10-20. The word rendered \"evil\" in line 1 is a conjectural addition. Apparently Borgny was present at Atli's court while the love affair between Oddrun and Gunnar was in progress, and criticised Oddrun for her part in it. [i]A draught[/i], etc.: apparently in reference to a secret meeting of the lovers.\n\n12. In the manuscript this stanza follows stanza 9; cf. note on stanzas 10-20. No gap is indicated, but something has presumably been lost. Grundtvig supplies as a first line: \"The maid her evil days remembered,\" and inserts as a second line line 5 of stanza 9.]"

The manuscript indicates line 3, but not line 1, as the beginning of a new stanza; some editions combine lines 3-4 with lines 3-4 of stanza 15. Making Buthli plan the marriage of Oddrun and Gunnar may be a sheer invention of the poet, or may point to an otherwise lost version of the legend.\n\n15. Lines 1-2 have here been transposed from the middle of stanza 19; cf. note on stanzas 10-20. [i]Wish-maid[/i]: a Valkyrie, so called because the Valkyries fullfilled Othin's wish in choosing the slain heroes for Valhall. The reference to Brynhild as a Valkyrie by no means fits with the version of the story used in stanzas 16-17, and the poet seems to have attempted to combine the two contradictory traditions, cf. [i]Fafnismol[/i], note on stanza 44. In the manuscript stanzas 10-11 follow line 4 of stanza 15.]"

This version is, of course, utterly at variance with the one in which Sigurth wins Brynhild for Gunnar by riding through the ring of flames, and is probably more closely akin to the early German traditions. In the [i]Nibelungenlied[/i] Brynhild appears as a queen ruling over lands and peoples. [i]Fafnir's slayer[/i]: Sigurth.\n\n17. Cf. note on preceding stanza.\n\n19. Cf.

[i]Murky wood[/i]: the forest which divided Atli's realm from that of the Gjukungs is in [i]Atlakvitha[/i], 3, called Myrkwood.

In the manuscript the three lines of stanza 27 follow line 2, and line 3 is marked as beginning a new stanza. [i]Geirmund[/i]: nothing further is known of him, but he seems to be an ally or retainer of Atli, or possibly his brother. [i]Hlesey[/i]: the poet's geography is here in very bad shape. Hlesey is (or may be) the Danish island of Läsö, in the Kattegat (cf. [i]Harbarthsljoth[/i], 37 and note), and thither he has suddenly transported not only Gunnar's death-place but Atli's whole dwelling (cf. stanza 29), despite his previous references to the ride to Hunland (stanzas 3-4) and the \"murky wood\" (stanza 23). Geirmund's home, where Oddrun has gone, is separated from Hlesey and Atli's dwelling by a sound (stanza 29). However, geographical accuracy is seldom to be looked for in heroic epic poetry.\n\n29.
