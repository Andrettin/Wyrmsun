		text = "[i]Guthrun's Inciting[/i]\n\nINTRODUCTORY NOTE\n\nThe two concluding poems in the [i]Codex Regius[/i], the [i]Guthrunarhvot[/i] ([i]Guthrun's Inciting[/i]) and the [i]Hamthesmol[/i] ([i]The Ballad of Hamther[/i]), belong to a narrative cycle connected with those of Sigurth, the Burgundians, and Atli (cf. [i]Gripisspo[/i], introductory note) by only the slenderest of threads. Of the three early historical kings who gradually assumed a dominant place in Germanic legend, Ermanarich, king of the East Goths in the middle of the fourth century, was actually the least important, even though Jordanes, the sixth century author of [i]De Rebus Getecis[/i], compared him to Alexander the Great. Memories of his cruelty and of his tragic death, however, persisted along with the real glories of Theoderich, a century and a half later, and of the conquests of Attila, whose lifetime approximately bridged the gap between Ermanarich's death and Theoderich's birth.\n\nChief among the popular tales of Ermanarich's cruelty was one concerning the death of a certain Sunilda or Sanielh, whom, according to Jordanes, he caused to be torn asunder by wild horses because of her husband's treachery. Her brothers, Sarus and Ammius, seeking to avenge her, wounded but failed to kill Ermanarich. In this story is the root of the two Norse poems included in the [i]Codex Regius[/i]. Sunilda easily became the wife as well as the victim of the tyrant, and, by the process of legend-blending so frequently observed, the story was connected with the more famous one of the Nibelungs by making her the daughter of Sigurth and Guthrun. To account for her brothers, a third husband had to be found for Guthrun; the Sarus and Ammius of Jordanes are obviously the Sorli and Hamther, sons of Guthrun and Jonak, of the Norse poems. The blending of the Sigurth and Ermanarich legends probably, though not certainly, took place before the story reached the North, in other words before the end of the eighth century.\n\nRegarding the exact status of the [i]Guthrunarhvot[/i] and the [i]Hamthesmol[/i] there has been a great deal of discussion. That they are closely related is obvious; indeed the first parts of the two poems are nearly identical in content and occasionally so in actual diction. The annotator, in his concluding prose note, refers to"

		text = "the second poem as the \"old\" ballad of Hamther, wherefore it has been assumed by some critics that the composer of the [i]Guthrunarhvot[/i] used the [i]Hamthesmol[/i], approximately as it now stands, as the source of part of his material. The extant [i]Hamthesmol[/i], however, is almost certainly a patchwork; part of it is in [i]Fornyrthislag[/i] (cf. Introduction), including most of the stanzas paralleled in the [i]Guthrunarhvot[/i], and likewise the stanza followed directly by the reference to the \"old\" ballad, while the rest is in Malahattr. The most reasonable theory, therefore, is that there existed an old ballad of Hamther, all in Fornyrthislag, from which the composer of the [i]Guthrunarhvot[/i] borrowed a few stanzas as the introduction for his poem, and which the composer of the extant, or \"new,\" [i]Hamthesmol[/i] likewise used, though far more clumsily.\n\nThe title \"Guthrunarhvot,\" which appears in the [i]Codex Regius[/i], really applies only to stanzas 1-8, all presumably borrowed from the \"old\" ballad of Hamther. The rest of the poem is simply another Guthrun lament, following the tradition exemplified by the first and second Guthrun lays; it is possible, indeed, that it is made up of fragments of two separate laments, one (stanzas 9-18) involving the story of Svanhild's death, and the other (stanzas 19-21) coming from an otherwise lost version of the story in which Guthrun closely follows Sigurth and Brynhild in death. In any event the present title is really a misnomer; the poet, who presumably was an eleventh century Icelander, used the episode of Guthrun's inciting her sons to vengeance for the slaying of Svanhild simply as an introduction to his main subject, the last lament of the unhappy queen.\n\nThe text of the poem in [i]Regius[/i] is by no means in good shape, and editorial emendations have been many and varied, particularly in interchanging lines between the [i]Guthrunarhvot[/i] and the [i]Hamthesmol[/i]. The [i]Volsungasaga[/i] paraphrases the poem with such fidelity as to prove that it lay before the compilers of the saga approximately in its present form.\n\n__________________\n\nGuthrun went forth to the sea after she had slain Atli.

With him was Bikki, who counselled that Randver, the king's son, should have her. This Bikki told to the king. The king had Randver hanged, and Svanhild trodden to death under horses' feet. And when Guthrun learned this, she spake with her sons.\n\n[[i]Prose[/i]. In the manuscript the prose is headed \"Of Guthrun,\" the title \"Guthrunarhvot\" preceding stanza 1. The prose introduction is used both by Snorri ([i]Skaldskaparmal[/i], chapter 42) and in the [i]Volsungasaga[/i]. It would be interesting to know on what the annotator based this note, for neither Bikki nor Randver is mentioned by name in either the [i]Guthrunarhvot[/i] or the [i]Hamthesmol[/i]. On the prose notes in general, cf. [i]Reginsmol[/i], introductory note. [i]Guthrun[/i]: on the slaying of Atli by his wife, Guthrun, Sigurth's widow, cf. [i]Atlamol[/i], 83-86 and notes. [i]Jonak[/i]: a Northern addition to the legend, introduced to account for Svanhild's half-brothers; the name is apparently of Slavic origin. [i]Sorli[/i], [i]Erp[/i], and [i]Hamther[/i]: Sorli and Hamther are the Sarus and Ammius of the Jordanes story (cf. introductory note). The [i]Volsungasaga[/i] follows this note in making Erp likewise a son of Guthrun, but in the [i]Hamthesmol[/i] he is a son of Jonak by another wife. [i]Svanhild[/i]: cf. [i]Sigurtharkvitha[/i] [i]en[/i] [i]skamma[/i], 54 and note. [i]Jormunrek[/i] (Ermanarich): cf. introductory note. [i]Bikki[/i]: the Sifka or Sibicho of the Gothic legends of Ermanarich, whose evil counsel always brings trouble. [i]Randver[/i]: in the [i]Volsungasaga[/i] Jormunrek sends his son Randver with Bikki to seek Svanhild's hand. On the voyage home Bikki says to Randver: \"It were right for you to have so fair a wife, and not such an old man.\" Randver was much pleased with this advice, \"and he spake to her with gladness, and she to him.\" Thus the story becomes near of kin to those of Tristan and Iseult and Paolo and Francesca. According to the [i]Volsungasaga[/i], Bikki told Ermanarich that a guilty love existed between his son and his young wife, and presumably the annotator here meant as much by his vague \"this.\"]"

The resemblance between stanzas 19-21 and stanzas 64-69 of [i]Sigurtharkvitha en skamma[/i] suggests that, in some other wise lost version of the story, Guthrun, like Brynhild, sought to die soon after Sigurth's death.
