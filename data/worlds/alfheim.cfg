	#description = "The forests of the lush world of Alfheim are characterized by the beautiful golden foliage of the fairlimbed trees, which are much adored by the elves. The planet orbits a star known as Fairwheel, and is in turn orbited by a moon called Timeteller. Alfheim was originally entirely devoid of life, until the Vanir used their magic to introduce a few creatures and plants from other worlds. Doing so left their powers spent for aeons, however. Centuries after the elves first achieved spacefaring capability, they decided to use their advanced technology to create an artificial \"sun\" for Alfheim - in truth a fiery moon - to lengthen the days and shorten the darkness. Eventually, the elves wanted to live under sunlight at all times, and the construction of a third \"sun\" started. An accident during the construction caused the third-sun-in-the-making to blow up, causing devastation on the planet. This catastrophe, added with the unnatural existence of the second sun, caused the earth to be scorched with high temperatures, and thus the fields dried up, forests died, and swamps turned into mud-cracked plains."

	background = "Alfheim was the world of the light elves in Norse mythology. In the [url=literary_text:alvissmol]Alvissmol[/url] it is mentioned that elves' term for \"wood\" is \"fair-limbed\". In that same poem, \"the Teller of Time\" is said to be the elves' term for the moon, and \"Fair Wheel\" their term for the sun. The [url=literary_text:grimnismol]Grimnismol[/url] mentions that Alfheim was given to the Norse god Freyr by the other deities."
