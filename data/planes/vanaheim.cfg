	description = "Vanaheim is home to the deities known as the Vanir. In archaic times, the Vanir fought a war with the Aesir of Asgard. With the conflict ending inconclusively, the two pantheons agreed to a peace, it being decided that a few deities from each group should live in the other's realm, to ensure good behavior from both parties. Most of the worshippers of the Vanir are elves, though Germanic peoples also revere the Vanir who went to live in Asgard."
