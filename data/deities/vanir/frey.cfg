	description = "Frey is one of the Vanir, a group of deities originally worshipped solely by elves. With the conclusion of the war between the Aesir and the Vanir, the two pantheons agreed to a peace, and that a few of each group should live among the other. Frey was one of the Vanir who went to dwell in Asgard with the Aesir, accompanied by his father Njord and his sister Freyja. The Germanic peoples, who worshipped the Aesir, eventually came to worship Frey. Frey is a god of fertility, light and war."
