When thunderstorms occurred, his priests visited the oak to try to communicate with him. Perkuno appears as a middle-aged man with a black beard and possessing a wrathful expression, with his head being crowned by flames. The Baltic Prussians attributed their fundamental laws to him. Perkuno's symbol is the perpetual fire."
