					"There is scarcely any literary work of great importance which has been less readily available for the general reader, or even for the serious student of literature, than the Poetic Edda. Translations have been far from numerous, and only in Germany has the complete work of translation been done in the full light of recent scholarship. In English the only versions were long the conspicuously inadequate one made by Thorpe, and published about half a century ago, and the unsatisfactory prose translations in Vigfusson and Powell's ~<Corpus Poeticum Boreale~>, reprinted in the Norroena collection. An excellent translation of the poems dealing with the gods, in verse and with critical and explanatory notes, made by Olive Bray, was, however, published by the Viking Club of London in 1908. In French there exist only partial translations, chief among them being those made by Bergmann many years ago. Among the seven or eight German versions, those by the Brothers Grimm and by Karl Simrock, which had considerable historical importance because of their influence on nineteenth century German literature and art, and particularly on the work of Richard Wagner, have been largely superseded by Hugo Gering's admirable translation, published in 1892, and by the recent two volume rendering by Genzmer, with excellent notes by Andreas Heusler, 194-1920. There are competent translations in both Norwegian and Swedish. The lack of any complete and adequately annotated English rendering in metrical form, based on a critical text, and profiting by the cumulative labors of such scholars as Mogk, Vigfusson,",
					
					"Finnur Jonsson, Grundtvig, Bugge, Gislason, Hildebrand, Lüning, Sweet, Niedner, Ettmüller, Müllenhoff, Edzardi, B. M. Olsen, Sievers, Sijmons, Detter, Heinzel, Falk, Neckel, Heusler, and Gering, has kept this extraordinary work practically out of the reach of those who have had neither time nor inclination to master the intricacies of the original Old Norse. \n\nOn the importance of the material contained in the ~<Poetic Edda~> it is here needless to dwell at any length. We have inherited the Germanic traditions in our very speech, and the ~<Poetic Edda~> is the original storehouse of Germanic mythology. It is, indeed, in many ways the greatest literary monument preserved to us out of the antiquity of the kindred races which we call Germanic. Moreover, it has a literary value altogether apart from its historical significance. The mythological poems include, in the ~<Voluspo~>, one of the vastest conceptions of the creation and ultimate destruction of the world ever crystallized in literary form; in parts of the ~<Hovamol~>, a collection of wise counsels that can bear comparison with most of the Biblical Book of Proverbs; in the ~<Lokasenna~>, a comedy none the less full of vivid characterization because its humor is often broad; and in the ~<Thrymskvitha~>, one of the finest ballads in the world. The hero poems give us, in its oldest and most vivid extant form, the story of Sigurth, Brynhild, and Atli, the Norse parallel to the German ~<Nibelungenlied~>. The Poetic Edda is not only of great interest to the student of antiquity; it is a collection including some of the most remark able poems which have been preserved to us from the period before the pen and the printing-press. replaced the poet-singer and oral tradition. It is above all else the desire",
					
					"to make better known the dramatic force, the vivid and often tremendous imagery, and the superb conceptions embodied in these poems which has called forth the present translation. \n\n~<What is the Poetic Edda?~>\n\nEven if the poems of the so-called Edda were not so significant and intrinsically so valuable, the long series of scholarly struggles which have been going on over them for the better part of three centuries would in itself give them a peculiar interest. Their history is strangely mysterious. We do not know who composed them, or when or where they were composed; we are by no means sure who collected them or when he did so; finally, we are not absolutely certain as to what an \"Edda\" is, and the best guess at the meaning of the word renders its application to this collection of poems more or less misleading. \n\nA brief review of the chief facts in the history of the ~<Poetic Edda~> will explain why this uncertainty has persisted. Preserved in various manuscripts of the thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries is a prose work consisting of a very extensive collection of mythological stories, an explanation of the important figures and tropes of Norse poetic diction,--the poetry of the Icelandic and Norwegian skalds was appallingly complex in this respect,--and a treatise on metrics. This work, clearly a handbook for poets, was commonly known as the \"Edda\" of Snorri Sturluson, for at the head of the copy of it in the ~<Uppsalabok~>, a manuscript written presumably some fifty or sixty years after Snorri's death, which was in 1241, we find: \"This book is called Edda, which Snorri Sturluson composed.\" This work, well known as the ~<Prose Edda~>, Snorri's ~<Edda~> or the",
					
					"~<Younger Edda~>, has recently been made available to readers of English in the admirable translation by Arthur G. Brodeur, published by the American-Scandinavian Foundation in 1916.\n\nIcelandic tradition, however, persisted in ascribing either this ~<Edda~> or one resembling it to Snorri's much earlier compatriot, Sæmund the Wise (1056-1133). When, early in the seventeenth century, the learned Arngrimur Jonsson proved to everyone's satisfaction that Snorri and nobody else must have been responsible for the work in question, the next thing to determine was what, if anything, Sæmund had done of the same kind. The nature of Snorri's book gave a clue. In the mythological stories related a number of poems were quoted, and as these and other poems were to all appearances Snorri's chief sources of information, it was assumed that Sæmund must have written or compiled a verse ~<Edda~>--whatever an \"Edda\" might be--on which Snorri's work was largely based.\n\nSo matters stood when, in 1643, Brynjolfur Sveinsson, Bishop of Skalholt, discovered a manuscript, clearly written as early as 1300, containing twenty-nine poems, complete or fragmentary, and some of them with the very lines and stanzas used by Snorri. Great was the joy of the scholars, for here, of course, must be at least a part of the long-sought ~<Edda~> of Sæmund the Wise. Thus the good bishop promptly labeled his find, and as Sæmund's ~<Edda~>, the ~<Elder Edda~> or the ~<Poetic Edda~> it has been known to this day.\n\nThis precious manuscript, now in the Royal Library in Copenhagen, and known as the ~<Codex~> ~<Regius~> (R2365), has been the basis for all published editions of the Eddic poems. A few poems of similar character found elsewhere",
					
					"have subsequently been added to the collection, until now most editions include, as in this translation, a total of thirty-four. A shorter manuscript now in the Arnamagnæan collection in Copenhagen (AM748), contains fragmentary or complete versions of six of the poems in the ~<Codex Regius~>, and one other, ~<Baldrs Draumar~>, not found in that collection. Four other poems (~<Rigsthula~>, ~<Hyndluljoth~>, ~<Grougaldr~> and ~<Fjolsvinnsmol~>, the last two here combined under the title of Svipdagsmol), from various manuscripts, so closely resemble in subject-matter and style the poems in the ~<Codex Regius~> that they have been included by most editors in the collection. Finally, Snorri's ~<Edda~> contains one complete poem, the ~<Grottasongr~>, which many editors have added to the poetic collection; it is, however, not included in this translation, as an admirable English version of it is available in Mr. Brodeur's rendering of Snorri's work.\n\nFrom all this it is evident that the ~<Poetic Edda~>, as we now know it, is no definite and plainly limited work, but rather a more or less haphazard collection of separate poems, dealing either with Norse mythology or with hero-cycles unrelated to the traditional history of greater Scandinavia or Iceland. How many other similar poems, now lost, may have existed in such collections as were current in Iceland in the later twelfth and thirteenth centuries we cannot know, though it is evident that some poems of this type are missing. We can say only that thirty-four poems have been preserved, twenty-nine of them in a single manuscript collection, which differ considerably in subject-matter and style from all the rest of extant Old Norse poetry, and these we group together as the ~<Poetic Edda~>.",
					
					"But what does the word \"Edda\" mean? Various guesses have been made. An early assumption was that the word somehow meant \"Poetics,\" which fitted Snorri's treatise to a nicety, but which, in addition to the lack of philological evidence to support this interpretation, could by no stretch of scholarly subtlety be made appropriate to the collection of poems. Jacob Grimm ingeniously identified the word with the word \"edda\" used in one of the poems, the ~<Rigsthula~>, where, rather conjecturally, it means \"great-grand mother.\" The word exists in this sense no where else in Norse literature, and Grimm's suggestion of \"Tales of a Grandmother,\" though at one time it found wide acceptance, was grotesquely inappropriate to either the prose or the verse work.\n\nAt last Eirikr Magnusson hit on what appears the likeliest solution of the puzzle: that \"Edda\" is simply the genitive form of the proper name \"Oddi.\" Oddi was a settlement in the southwest of Iceland, certainly the home of Snorri Sturluson for many years, and, traditionally at least, also the home of Sæmund the Wise. That Snorri's work should have been called \"The Book of Oddi\" is altogether reasonable, for such a method of naming books was common--witness the \"Book of the Flat Island\" and other early manuscripts. That Sæmund may also have written or compiled another \"Oddi-Book\" is perfectly possible, and that tradition should have said he did so is entirely natural.\n\nIt is, however, an open question whether or not Sæmund had anything to do with making the collection, or any part of it, now known as the Poetic Edda, for of course the seventeenth-century assignment of the work to him is negligible.",
					
					"We can say only that he may have made some such compilation, for he was a diligent student of Icelandic tradition and history, and was famed throughout the North for his learning. But otherwise no trace of his works survives, and as he was educated in Paris, it is probable that he wrote rather in Latin than in the vernacular.\n\nAll that is reasonably certain is that by the middle or last of the twelfth century there existed in Iceland one or more written collections of Old Norse mythological and heroic poems, that the ~<Codex Regius~>, a copy made a hundred years or so later, represents at least a considerable part of one of these, and that the collection of thirty-four poems which we now know as the ~<Poetic~> or ~<Elder Edda~> is practically all that has come down to us of Old Norse poetry of this type. Anything more is largely guesswork, and both the name of the compiler and the meaning of the title \"Edda\" are conjectural.\n\n~<The Origin of the Eddic Poems~>\n\nThere is even less agreement about the birthplace, authorship and date of the Eddic poems themselves than about the nature of the existing collection. Clearly the poems were the work of many different men, living in different periods; clearly, too, most of them existed in oral tradition for generations before they were committed to writing. In general, the mythological poems seem strongly marked by pagan sincerity, although efforts have been made to prove them the results of deliberate archaizing; and as Christianity became generally accepted throughout the Norse world early in the eleventh century, it seems altogether likely that most of the poems dealing",
					
					"with the gods definitely antedate the year 1000. The earlier terminus is still a matter of dispute. The general weight of critical opinion, based chiefly on the linguistic evidence presented by Hoffory, Finnur Jonsson and others, has indicated that the poems did not assume anything closely analogous to their present forms prior to the ninth century. On the other hand, Magnus Olsen's interpretation of the inscriptions on the Eggjum Stone, which he places as early as the seventh century, have led so competent a scholar as Birger Nerman to say that \"we may be warranted in concluding that some of the Eddic poems may have originated, wholly or partially, in the second part of the seventh century.\" As for the poems belonging to the hero cycles, one or two of them appear to be as late as 1100, but most of them probably date back at least to the century and a half following 900. It is a reasonable guess that the years between 850 and 1050 saw the majority of the Eddic poems worked into definite shape, but it must be remembered that many changes took place during the long subsequent period of oral transmission, and also that many of the legends, both mythological and heroic, on which the poems were based certainly existed in the Norse regions, and quite possibly in verse form, long before the year 900.\n\nAs to the origin of the legends on which the poems are based, the whole question, at least so far as the stories of the gods are concerned, is much too complex for discussion here. How much of the actual narrative material of the mythological lays is properly to be called Scandinavian is a matter for students of comparative mythology to",
					
					"guess at. The tales underlying the heroic lays are clearly of foreign origin: the Helgi story comes from Denmark, and that of Völund from Germany, as also the great mass of traditions centering around Sigurth (Siegfried), Brynhild, the sons of Gjuki, Atli (Attila), and Jormunrek (Ermanarich). The introductory notes to the various poems deal with the more important of these questions of origin. of the men who composed these poems,--\"wrote\" is obviously the wrong word--we know absolutely nothing, save that some of them must have been literary artists with a high degree of conscious skill. The Eddic poems are \"folk-poetry,\"--whatever that may be,--only in the sense that some of them strongly reflect racial feelings and beliefs; they are anything but crude or primitive in workmanship, and they show that not only the poets themselves, but also many of their hearers, must have made a careful study of the art of poetry.\n\nWhere the poems were shaped is equally uncertain. Any date prior to 875 would normally imply an origin on the mainland, but the necessarily fluid state of oral tradition made it possible for a poem to be \"composed\" many times over, and in various and far-separated places, without altogether losing its identity. Thus, even if a poem first assumed something approximating its present form in Iceland in the tenth century, it may none the less embody language characteristic of Norway two centuries earlier. Oral poetry has always had an amazing preservative power over language, and in considering the origins of such poems as these, we must cease thinking in terms of the printing-press, or even in those of the scribe. The",
					
					"claims of Norway as the birthplace of most of the Eddic poems have been extensively advanced, but the great literary activity of Iceland after the settlement of the island by Norwegian emigrants late in the ninth century makes the theory of an Icelandic home for many of the poems appear plausible. The two Atli lays, with what authority we do not know, bear in the ~<Codex Regius~> the superscription \"the Greenland poem,\" and internal evidence suggests that this statement may be correct. Certainly in one poem, the ~<Rigsthula~>, and probably in several others, there are marks of Celtic influence. During a considerable part of the ninth and tenth centuries, Scandinavians were active in Ireland and in most of the western islands inhabited by branches of the Celtic race. Some scholars have, indeed, claimed nearly all the Eddic poems for these \"Western Isles.\" However, as Iceland early came to be the true cultural center of this Scandinavian island world, it may be said that the preponderant evidence concerning the development of the Eddic poems in anything like their present form points in that direction, and certainly it was in Iceland that they were chiefly preserved.\n\n~<The Edda and Old Norse Literature~>\n\nWithin the proper limits of an introduction it would be impossible to give any adequate summary of the history and literature with which the Eddic poems are indissolubly connected, but a mere mention of a few of the salient facts may be of some service to those who are unfamiliar with the subject. Old Norse literature covers approximately the period between 850 and 1300. During the first part of",
					
					"that period occurred the great wanderings of the Scandinavian peoples, and particularly the Norwegians. A convenient date to remember is that of the sea-fight of Hafrsfjord, 872, when Harald the Fair-Haired broke the power of the independent Norwegian nobles, and made himself overlord of nearly all the country. Many of the defeated nobles fled overseas, where inviting refuges had been found for them by earlier wanderers and plunder-seeking raiders. This was the time of the inroads of the dreaded Northmen in France, and in 885 Hrolf Gangr (Rollo) laid siege to Paris itself. Many Norwegians went to Ireland, where their compatriots had already built Dublin, and where they remained in control of most of the island till Brian Boru shattered their power at the battle of Clontarf in 1014.\n\nOf all the migrations, however, the most important were those to Iceland. Here grew up an active civilization, fostered by absolute independence and by remoteness from the wars which wracked Norway, yet kept from degenerating into provincialism by the roving life of the people, which brought them constantly in contact with the culture of the South. Christianity, introduced throughout the Norse world about the year 1000, brought with it the stability of learning, and the Icelanders became not only the makers but also the students and recorders of history. The years between 875 and 1100 were the great spontaneous period of oral literature. Most of the military and political leaders were also poets, and they composed a mass of lyric poetry concerning the authorship of which we know a good deal, and much of which has been preserved. Narrative",
					
					"prose also flourished, for the Icelander had a passion for story-telling and story-hearing. After 1100 came the day of the writers. These sagamen collected the material that for generations had passed from mouth to mouth, and gave it permanent form in writing. The greatest bulk of what we now have of Old Norse literature,--and the published part of it makes a formidable library,--originated thus in the earlier period before the introduction of writing, and was put into final shape by the scholars, most of them Icelanders, of the hundred years following 1150.\n\nAfter 1250 came a rapid and tragic decline. Iceland lost its independence, becoming a Norwegian province. Later Norway too fell under alien rule, a Swede ascending the Norwegian throne in 1320. Pestilence and famine laid waste the whole North; volcanic disturbances worked havoc in Iceland. Literature did not quite die, but it fell upon evil days; for the vigorous native narratives and heroic poems of the older period were substituted translations of French romances. The poets wrote mostly doggerel; the prose writers were devoid of national or racial inspiration.\n\nThe mass of literature thus collected and written down largely between 1150 and 1250 maybe roughly divided into four groups. The greatest in volume is made up of the sagas: narratives mainly in prose, ranging all the way from authentic history of the Norwegian kings and the early Icelandic settlements to fairy-tales. Embodied in the sagas is found the material composing the second group: the skaldic poetry, a vast collection of songs of praise, triumph, love, lamentation, and so on, almost uniformly characterized",
					
					"by an appalling complexity of figurative language. There is no absolute line to be drawn between the poetry of the skalds and the poems of the ~<Edda~>, which we may call the third group; but in addition to the remarkable artificiality of style which marks the skaldic poetry, and which is seldom found in the poems of the ~<Edda~>, the skalds dealt almost exclusively with their own emotions, whereas the Eddic poems are quite impersonal. Finally, there is the fourth group, made up of didactic works, religious and legal treatises, and so on, studies which originated chiefly in the later period of learned activity.\n\n~<Preservation of the Eddic Poems~>\n\nMost of the poems of the ~<Poetic Edda~> have unquestionably reached us in rather bad shape. During the long period of oral transmission they suffered all sorts of interpolations, omissions and changes, and some of them, as they now stand, are a bewildering hodge-podge of little related fragments. To some extent the diligent twelfth century compiler to whom we owe the ~<Codex Regius~>--Sæmund or another--was himself doubtless responsible for the patchwork process, often supplemented by narrative prose notes of his own; but in the days before written records existed, it was easy to lose stanzas and longer passages from their context, and equally easy to interpolate them where they did not by any means belong. Some few of the poems, however, appear to be virtually complete and unified as we now have them.\n\nUnder such circumstances it is clear that the establishment of a satisfactory text is a matter of the utmost difficulty. As the basis for this translation I have used the text",
					
					"prepared by Karl Hildebrand (1876) and revised by Hugo Gering (1904). Textual emendation has, however, been so extensive in every edition of the ~<Edda~>, and has depended so much on the theories of the editor, that I have also made extensive use of many other editions, notably those by Finnur Jonsson, Neckel, Sijmons, and Detter and Heinzel, together with numerous commentaries. The condition of the text in both the principal codices is such that no great reliance can be placed on the accuracy of the copyists, and frequently two editions will differ fundamentally as to their readings of a given passage or even of an entire-poem. For this reason, and because guesswork necessarily plays so large a part in any edition or translation of the Eddic poems, I have risked overloading the pages with textual notes in order to show, as nearly as possible, the exact state of the original together with all the more significant emendations. I have done this particularly in the case of transpositions, many of which appear absolutely necessary, and in the indication of passages which appear to be interpolations.\n\n~<The Verse-Forms of the Eddic Poems~>\n\nThe many problems connected with the verse-forms found in the Eddic poems have been analyzed in great detail by Sievers, Neckel, and others. The three verse-forms exemplified in the poems need only a brief comment here, however, in order to make clear the method used in this translation. All of these forms group the lines normally in four-line stanzas. In the so-called Fornyrthislag (\"Old Verse\"), for convenience sometimes referred to in the notes as four-four measure, these lines have all the same",
					
					"structure, each line being sharply divided by a cæsural pause into two half-lines, and each half-line having two accented syllables and two (sometimes three) unaccented ones. The two half-lines forming a complete line are bound together by the alliteration, or more properly initial-rhyme, of three (or two) of the accented syllables. The following is an example of the Fornyrthislag stanza, the accented syllables being in italics:\n\n\t\t~<VreiÞr~> vas ~<Ving~>Þórr, | es ~<vakna~>Þi\n\t\tok ~<síns ham~>ars | of ~<sakna~>Þi;\n\t\t~<skegg~> nam ~<hris~>ta, | ~<skor~> nam ~<dý~>ja,\n\t\t~<ré~>Þ ~<JarÞ~>ar ~<burr~> | ~<umb~> at ~<Þreif~>ask.\n\nIn the second form, the Ljothahattr (\"Song Measure\"), the first and third line of each stanza are as just described, but the second and fourth are shorter, have no cæsural pause, have three accented syllables, and regularly two initial-rhymed accented syllables, for which reason I have occasionally referred to Ljothahattr as four-three measure. The following is an example:\n\n\t\t~<Ar~> skal ~<rí~>sa | sás ~<an~>nars ~<vill~>\n\t\t\t~<fé~> eÞa ~<fior haf~>a;\n\t\t~<ligg~>jandi ~<ulfr~> | sjaldan ~<láer~> of ~<getr~>\n\t\t\tné ~<sof~>andi ~<maÞr sigr~>.\n\nIn the third and least commonly used form, the Malahattr (\"Speech Measure\"), a younger verse-form than either of the other two, each line of the four-line stanza is divided into two half-lines by a cæsural pause, each half line having two accented syllables and three (sometimes",
					
					"four) unaccented ones; the initial rhyme is as in the Fornyrthislag. The following is an example:\n\n\t\t~<Horsk~> vas ~<hús~>freyja, | ~<hug~>Þi at ~<mann~>viti,\n\t\t~<lag~> heyrÞi ~<ór~>Þa, | hvat á ~<laun máel~>tu;\n\t\tÞá vas ~<vant vit~>ri, | ~<vil~>di Þeim ~<hjalÞ~>a:\n\t\tskyldu of ~<sáe sig~>la, | en ~<sjolf~> né ~<kvamsk~>at.\n\nA poem in Fornyrthislag is normally entitled -~<kvitha~> (~<Thrymskvitha~>, ~<Guthrunarkvitha~>, etc.), which for convenience I have rendered as \"lay,\" while a poem in Ljothahattr is entitled -~<mol~> (~<Grimnismol~>, ~<Skirnismol~>, etc.), which I have rendered as \"ballad.\" It is difficult to find any distinction other than metrical between the two terms, although it is clear that one originally existed.\n\nVariations frequently appear in all three kinds of verse, and these I have attempted to indicate through the rhythm of the translation. In order to preserve so far as possible the effect of the Eddic verse, I have adhered, in making the English version, to certain of the fundamental rules governing the Norse line and stanza formations. The number of lines to each stanza conforms to what seems the best guess as to the original, and I have consistently retained the number of accented syllables. in translating from a highly inflected language into one depending largely on the use of subsidiary words, it has, however, been necessary to employ considerable freedom as to the number of unaccented syllables in a line. The initial-rhyme is generally confined to two accented syllables in each line. As in the original, all initial vowels are allowed to rhyme interchangeably, but I have disregarded the rule which lets certain groups of consonants rhyme only with themselves",

					"~<Voluspo~>\n\n~<The Wise-Woman's Prophecy~>\n\n~<Introductory Note~>\n\nAt the beginning of the collection in the ~<Codex~> ~<Regius~> stands the Voluspo, the most famous and important, as it is likewise the most debated, of all the Eddic poems. Another version of it is found in a huge miscellaneous compilation of about the year 1300, the ~<Hauksbok~>, and many stanzas are included in the ~<Prose Edda~> of Snorri Sturluson. The order of the stanzas in the ~<Hauksbok~> version differs materially from that in the ~<Codex~> ~<Regius~>, and in the published editions many experiments have been attempted in further rearrangements. On the whole, how ever, and allowing for certain interpolations, the order of the stanzas in the ~<Codex~> ~<Regius~> seems more logical than any of the wholesale \"improvements\" which have been undertaken.\n\nThe general plan of the ~<Voluspo~> is fairly clear. Othin, chief of the gods, always conscious of impending disaster and eager for knowledge, calls on a certain \"Volva,\" or wise-woman, presumably bidding her rise from the grave. She first tells him of the past, of the creation of the world, the beginning of years, the origin of the dwarfs (at this point there is a clearly interpolated catalogue of dwarfs' names, stanzas 10-16), of the first man and woman, of the world-ash Yggdrasil, and of the first war, between the gods and the Vanir, or, in Anglicized form, the Wanes. Then, in stanzas 27-29, as a further proof of her wisdom, she discloses some of Othin's own secrets and the details of his search for knowledge. Rewarded by Othin for what she has thus far told (stanza 30), she then turns to the real prophesy, the disclosure of the final destruction of the gods. This final battle, in which fire and flood overwhelm heaven and earth as the gods fight with their enemies, is the great fact in Norse mythology; the phrase describing it, ~<ragna~> ~<rök~>, \"the fate of the gods,\" has become familiar, by confusion with the word rökkr, \"twilight,\" in the German ~<Göterdämmerung~>. The wise-woman tells of the Valkyries who bring the slain warriors to support Othin and the other gods in the battle, of the slaying of Baldr, best and fairest of the gods, through the wiles of Loki, of the enemies of the gods, of the summons to battle on both sides, and of the mighty struggle, till Othin is slain, and \"fire leaps high",
					
					"about heaven itself\" (stanzas 31-58). But this is not all. A new and beautiful world is to rise on the ruins of the old; Baldr comes back, and \"fields unsowed bear ripened fruit\" (stanzas 59-66).\n\nThis final passage, in particular, has caused wide differences of opinion as to the date and character of the poem. That the poet was heathen and not Christian seems almost beyond dispute; there is an intensity and vividness in almost every stanza which no archaizing Christian could possibly have achieved. On the other hand, the evidences of Christian influence are sufficiently striking to outweigh the arguments of Finnur Jonsson, Müllenhoff and others who maintain that the ~<Voluspo~> is purely a product of heathendom. The roving Norsemen of the tenth century, very few of whom had as yet accepted Christianity, were nevertheless in close contact with Celtic races which had already been converted, and in many ways the Celtic influence was strongly felt. It seems likely, then, that the ~<Voluspo~> was the work of a poet living chiefly in Iceland, though possibly in the \"Western Isles,\" in the middle of the tenth century, a vigorous believer in the old gods, and yet with an imagination active enough to be touched by the vague tales of a different religion emanating from his neighbor Celts.\n\nHow much the poem was altered during the two hundred years between its composition and its first being committed to writing is largely a matter of guesswork, but, allowing for such an obvious interpolation as the catalogue of dwarfs, and for occasional lesser errors, it seems quite needless to assume such great changes as many editors do. The poem was certainly not composed to tell a story with which its early hearers were quite familiar; the lack of continuity which baffles modern readers presumably did not trouble them in the least. It is, in effect, a series of gigantic pictures, put into words with a directness and sureness which bespeak the poet of genius. It is only after the reader, with the help of the many notes, has--familiarized him self with the names and incidents involved that he can begin to understand the effect which this magnificent poem must have produced on those who not only understood but believed it.",
					
					"1. Hearing I ask | from the holy races,\nFrom Heimdall's sons, | both high and low;\nThou wilt, Valfather, | that well I relate\nOld tales I remember | of men long ago.\n\n2. I remember yet | the giants of yore,\nWho gave me bread | in the days gone by;\nNine worlds I knew, | the nine in the tree\nWith mighty roots | beneath the mold.\n\n[1. A few editors, following Bugge, in an effort to clarify the poem, place stanzas 22, 28 and 30 before stanzas 1-20, but the arrangement in both manuscripts, followed here, seems logical. In stanza I the Volva, or wise-woman, called upon by Othin, answers him and demands a hearing. Evidently she be longs to the race of the giants (cf. stanza 2), and thus speaks to Othin unwillingly, being compelled to do so by his magic power. Holy: omitted in ~<Regius~>; the phrase \"holy races\" probably means little more than mankind in general. Heimdall: the watchman of the gods; cf. stanza 46 and note. Why mankind should be referred to as Heimdall's sons is uncertain, and the phrase has caused much perplexity. Heimdall seems to have had various at tributes, and in the Rigsthula, wherein a certain Rig appears as the ancestor of the three great classes of men, a fourteenth century annotator identifies Rig with Heimdall, on what authority we do not know, for the Rig of the poem seems much more like Othin (cf. Rigsthula, introductory prose and note). Valfather (\"Father of the Slain\"): Othin, chief of the gods, so called because the slain warriors were brought to him at Valhall (\"Hall of the Slain\") by the Valkyries (\"Choosers of the Slain\").\n\n2. Nine worlds: the worlds of the gods (Asgarth), of the Wanes (Vanaheim, cf. stanza 21 and note), of the elves (Alfheim), of men (Mithgarth), of the giants (Jotunheim), of fire (Muspellsheim, cf. stanza 47 and note), of the dark elves (Svartalfaheim), of the dead (Niflheim), and presumably of the dwarfs (perhaps Nithavellir, cf. stanza 37 and note, but the ninth world is uncertain).

Bur's sons: Othin, Vili, and Ve. Of Bur we know only that his wife was Bestla, daughter of Bolthorn; cf. ~<Hovamol~>, 141. Vili and Ve are mentioned by name in the Eddic poems only in ~<Lokasenna~>, 26. ~<Mithgarth~> (\"Middle Dwelling\"): the world of men. ~<Leeks~>: the leek was often used as the symbol of fine growth (cf. ~<Guthrunarkvitha~> I, 17), and it was also supposed to have magic power (cf. ~<Sigrdrifumol~>, 7).\n\n5. Various editors have regarded this stanza as interpolated; Hoffory thinks it describes the northern summer night in which the sun does not set. Lines 3-5 are quoted by Snorri. In the manuscripts line 4 follows line 5. Regarding the sun and moon]",

Possibly an interpolation, but there seems no strong reason for assuming this. Lines 1-2 are identical with lines 1-2 of stanza 9, and line 2 may have been inserted here from that later stanza.\n\n7. ~<Ithavoll~> (\"Field of Deeds\"?): mentioned only here and in stanza 60 as the meeting-place of the gods; it appears in no other connection.\n\n8. ~<Tables~>: the exact nature of this game, and whether it more closely resembled chess or checkers, has been made the subject of a 400-page treatise, Willard Fiske's \"Chess in Iceland.\" ~<Giant-maids~>: perhaps the three great Norns, corresponding to the three fates; cf. stanza 20, and note. Possibly, however, something has been lost after this stanza, and the missing passage, replaced by the catalogue of the dwarfs (stanzas 9-16), may have explained the \"giant-maids\" otherwise than as Norns. In ~<Vafthruthnismol~>, 49, the Norms (this time \"three throngs\" in stead of simply \"three\") are spoken of as giant-maidens;]",
					
					"9. Then sought the gods | their assembly-seats,\nThe holy ones, | and council held,\nTo find who should raise | the race of dwarfs\nOut of Brimir's blood | and the legs of Blain.\n\n10.

Here apparently begins the interpolated catalogue of the dwarfs, running through stanza 16; possibly, however, the interpolated section does not begin before stanza 11. Snorri quotes practically the entire section, the names appearing in a some what changed order. ~<Brimir~> and ~<Blain~>: nothing is known of these two giants, and it has been suggested that both are names for Ymir (cf. stanza 3). Brimir, however, appears in stanza 37 in connection with the home of the dwarfs. Some editors treat the words as common rather than proper nouns, Brimir meaning \"the bloody moisture\" and Blain being of uncertain significance.\n\n10. Very few of the dwarfs named in this and the following stanzas are mentioned elsewhere. It is not clear why Durin should have been singled out as authority for the list. The occasional repetitions suggest that not all the stanzas of the catalogue came from the same source. Most of the names presumably had some definite significance, as Northri, Suthri, Austri, and Vestri (\"North,\" \"South\", \"East,\" and \"West\"),]",

The order of the lines in this and the succeeding four stanzas varies greatly in the manuscripts and editions, and the names likewise appear in many forms. ~<Regin~>: probably not identical with Regin the son of Hreithmar, who plays an important part in the ~<Reginsmol~> and ~<Fafnismol~>, but cf. note on ~<Reginsmol~>, introductory prose.\n\n14. ~<Dvalin~>: in Hovamol, 144, Dvalin seems to have given magic runes to the dwarfs, probably accounting for their skill in craftsmanship, while in ~<Fafnismol~>, 13, he is mentioned as the father of some of the lesser Norns. The story that some of the dwarfs left the rocks and mountains to find a new home on the sands is mentioned, but unexplained, in Snorri's Edda; of ~<Lofar~> we know only that he was descended from these wanderers.]",

Here the poem resumes its course after the interpolated section. Probably, however, something has been lost, for there is no apparent connection between the three giant-maids of stanza 8 and the three gods, Othin, Hönir and Lothur, who in stanza 17 go forth to create man and woman. The word \"three\" in stanzas 9 and 17 very likely confused some early reciter, or perhaps the compiler himself. ~<Ask~> and ~<Embla~>: ash and elm; Snorri gives them simply as the names of the first man and woman, but says that the gods made this pair out of trees.\n\n18. ~<Hönir~>: little is known of this god, save that he occasionally appears in the poems in company with Othin and Loki, and]",

He was adopted by Othin, who subsequently had good reason to regret it. Loki probably represents the blending of two originally distinct figures, one of them an old fire-god, hence his gift of heat to the newly created pair.\n\n19. ~<Yggdrasil~>: cf. stanza 2 and note, and ~<Grimnismol~>, 29-35 and notes. Urth (\"The Past\"): one of the three great Norns. The world-ash is kept green by being sprinkled with the marvelous healing water from her well.\n\n20. ~<The maidens~>: the three Norns; possibly this stanza should follow stanza 8. ~<Dwelling~>: ~<Regius~> has \"sae\" (sea) instead of \"sal\" (hall, home), and many editors have followed this reading, although Snorri's prose paraphrase indicates \"sal.\" ~<Urth,~> ~<Verthandi~> ~<and~> ~<Skuld~>: \"Past,\" \"Present\" and \"Future.\" ~<Wood~>, etc.: the magic signs (runes) controlling the destinies of men were cut on pieces of wood.

This follows stanza 20 in ~<Regius~>; in the ~<Hauksbok~> version stanzas 25, 26, 27, 40, and 41 come between stanzas 20 and 21. Editors have attempted all sorts of rearrangements. ~<The war~>: the first war was that between the gods and the Wanes. The cult of the Wanes (Vanir) seems to have originated among the seafaring folk of the Baltic and the southern shores of the North Sea, and to have spread thence into Norway in opposition to the worship of the older gods; hence the \"war.\" Finally the two types of divinities were worshipped in common; hence the treaty which ended the war with the exchange of hostages. Chief among the Wanes were Njorth and his children, Freyr and Freyja, all of whom became conspicuous among the gods. Beyond this we know little of the Wanes, who seem originally to have been water-deities. ~<I remember~>: the manuscripts have \"she remembers,\" but the Volva is apparently still speaking of her own memories, as in stanza 2. ~<Gollveig~> (\"Gold-Might\"): apparently the first of the Wanes to come among the gods, her ill treatment being the immediate cause of the war. Müllenhoff maintains that Gollveig is another name for Freyja. Lines 5-6, one or both of them probably interpolated, seem to symbolize the refining of gold by fire. ~<Hor~> (\"The High One\"): Othin.\n\n22. ~<Heith~> (\"Shining One\"?): a name often applied to wise women and prophetesses.

It is also possible that the stanza is an interpolation. Bugge maintains that it applies to the Volva who is reciting the poem, and makes it the opening stanza, following it with stanzas 28 and 30, and then going on with stanzas I ff. The text of line 2 is obscure, and has been variously emended.\n\n23. This stanza and stanza 24 have been transposed from the order in the manuscripts, for the former describes the battle and the victory of the Wanes, after which the gods took council, debating whether to pay tribute to the victors, or to admit them, as was finally done, to equal rights of worship.\n\n25. Possibly, as Finn Magnusen long ago suggested, there is something lost after stanza 24, but it was not the custom of the Eddic poets to supply transitions which their hearers could generally be counted on to understand. The story referred to in stanzas 25-26 (both quoted by Snorri) is that of the rebuilding of Asgarth after its destruction by the Wanes. The gods employed a giant as builder, who demanded as his reward the sun and moon, and the goddess Freyja for his wife. The gods, terrified by the rapid progress of the work, forced Loki, who had advised the bargain, to delay the giant by a trick, so that the]",

The enraged giant then threatened the gods, whereupon Thor slew him. ~<Oth's~> ~<bride~>: Freyja; of Oth little is known beyond the fact that Snorri refers to him as a man who \"went away on long journeys.\"\n\n26. ~<Thor~>: the thunder-god, son of Othin and Jorth (Earth) cf. particularly Harbarthsljoth and Thrymskvitha, passim. ~<Oaths~>, etc.: the gods, by violating their oaths to the giant who rebuilt Asgarth, aroused the undying hatred of the giants' race, and thus the giants were among their enemies in the final battle.\n\n27. Here the Volva turns from her memories of the past to a statement of some of Othin's own secrets in his eternal search for knowledge (stanzas 27-29). Bugge puts this stanza after stanza 29. ~<The~> ~<horn~> ~<of~> ~<Heimdall~>: the Gjallarhorn (\"Shrieking Horn\"), with which Heimdall, watchman of the gods, will summon them to the last battle. Till that time the horn is buried under Yggdrasil. ~<Valfather's~> ~<pledge~>: Othin's eye (the sun?), which he gave to the water-spirit Mimir (or Mim) in exchange for the latter's wisdom. It appears here and in stanza 29 as a drinking-vessel, from which Mimir drinks the magic mead, and from which he pours water on the ash Yggdrasil. Othin's sacrifice of his eye in order to gain knowledge of his final doom is one of the series of disasters leading up to the destruction of the gods. There were several differing versions of the story of Othin's relations with Mimir; another one, quite incompatible with this, appears in stanza 47. In the manuscripts ~<I know~> and ~<I see~> appear as \"she knows\" and \"she sees\" (cf. note on 21).]",

The ~<Hauksbok~> version omits all of stanzas 28-34, stanza 27 being there followed by stanzas 40 and 41. ~<Regius~> indicates stanzas 28 and 29 as a single stanza. Bugge puts stanza 28 after stanza 22, as the second stanza of his reconstructed poem. The Volva here addresses Othin directly, intimating that, although he has not told her, she knows why he has come to her, and what he has already suffered in his search for knowledge regarding his doom. Her reiterated \"would you know yet more?\" seems to mean: \"I have proved my wisdom by telling of the past and of your own secrets; is it your will that I tell likewise of the fate in store for you?\" ~<The Old One~>: Othin.\n\n29. The first line, not in either manuscript, is a conjectural emendation based on Snorri's paraphrase. Bugge puts this stanza after stanza 20.\n\n30. This is apparently the transitional stanza, in which the Volva, rewarded by Othin for her knowledge of the past (stanzas 1-29), is induced to proceed with her real prophecy (stanzas 31-66).

They are also called \"Wish-Maidens,\" as the fulfillers of Othin's wishes. The conception of the supernatural warrior-maiden was presumably brought to Scandinavia in very early times from the South-Germanic races, and later it was interwoven with the likewise South-Germanic tradition of the swan-maiden. A third complication developed when the originally quite human women of the hero-legends were endowed with the qualities of both Valkyries and swan-maidens, as in the cases of Brynhild (cf. ~<Gripisspo~>, introductory note), ~<Svava~> (cf. ~<Helgakvitha~> ~<Hjorvarthssonar~>, prose after stanza 5 and note) and Sigrun (cf. ~<Helgakvitha~> ~<Hundingsbana~> I, 17 and note). The list of names here given may be an interpolation; a quite different list is given in ~<Grimnismol~>, 36. ~<Ranks of the gods~>: some editors regard the word thus translated as a specific place name. ~<Herjan~> (\"Leader of Hosts\"): Othin. It is worth noting that the name ~<Hild~> (\"Warrior\") is the basis of Bryn-hild (\"Warrior in Mail Coat\").\n\n32. Baldr: The death of Baldr, the son of Othin and Frigg, was the first of the great disasters to the gods. The story is fully told by Snorri. Frigg had demanded of all created things, saving only the mistletoe, which she thought too weak to be worth troubling]",
					
					"Famous and fair | in the lofty fields, | Full grown in strength | the mistletoe stood.\n\n33. From the branch which seemed | so slender and fair | Came a harmful shaft | that Hoth should hurl; | But the brother of Baldr | was born ere long, | And one night old | fought Othin's son.\n\n34. His hands he washed not, | his hair he combed not, | Till he bore to the bale-blaze | Baldr's foe. | But in Fensalir | did Frigg weep sore | For Valhall's need: | would you know yet more?\n\n35. One did I see | in the wet woods bound, | A lover of ill, | and to Loki like;\n\n[about, an oath that they would not harm Baldr. Thus it came to he a sport for the gods to hurl weapons at Baldr, who, of course, was totally unharmed thereby. Loki, the trouble-maker, brought the mistletoe to Baldr's blind brother, Hoth, and guided his hand in hurling the twig. Baldr was slain, and grief came upon all the gods. Cf. ~<Baldrs~> ~<Draumar~>.\n\n33. The lines in this and the following stanza have been combined in various ways by editors, lacunae having been freely conjectured, but the manuscript version seems clear enough. ~<The~> ~<brother~> ~<of~> ~<Baldr~>: Vali, whom Othin begot expressly to avenge Baldr's death. The day after his birth he fought and slew Hoth.\n\n34. ~<Frigg~>: Othin's wife. Some scholars have regarded her as a solar myth, calling her the sun-goddess, and pointing out that her home in ~<Fensalir~> (\"the sea-halls\") symbolizes the daily setting of the sun beneath the ocean horizon.\n\n35. The translation here follows the ~<Regius~> version. The ~<Hauksbok~> has the same final two lines, but in place of the first]",
					
					"By his side does Sigyn | sit, nor is glad\nTo see her mate: | would you know yet more?\n\n36. From the east there pours | through poisoned vales\nWith swords and daggers | the river Slith.\n. . . . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . . . .\n\n37. Northward a hall | in Nithavellir\nOf gold there rose | for Sindri's race;\nAnd in Okolnir | another stood,\nWhere the giant Brimir | his beer-hall had.\n\n[pair has, \"I know that Vali | his brother gnawed, / With his bowels then | was Loki bound.\" Many editors have followed this version of the whole stanza or have included these two lines, often marking them as doubtful, with the four from ~<Regius~>. After the murder of Baldr, the gods took Loki and bound him to a rock with the bowels of his son Narfi, who had just been torn to pieces by Loki's other son, Vali. A serpent was fastened above Loki's head, and the venom fell upon his face. Loki's wife, ~<Sigyn~>, sat by him with a basin to catch the venom, but whenever the basin was full, and she went away to empty it, then the venom fell on Loki again, till the earth shook with his struggles. \"And there he lies bound till the end.\" Cf. ~<Lokasenna~>, concluding prose.\n\n36. Stanzas 36-39 describe the homes of the enemies of the gods: the giants (36), the dwarfs (37), and the dead in the land of the goddess Hel (38-39). The ~<Hauksbok~> version omits stanzas 36 and 37. ~<Regius~> unites 36 with 37, but most editors have assumed a lacuna. ~<Slith~> (\"the Fearful\"): a river in the giants' home. The \"swords and daggers\" may represent the icy cold.\n\n37. ~<Nithavellir~> (\"the Dark Fields\"): a home of the dwarfs. Perhaps the word should be \"Nithafjoll\" (\"the Dark Crags\"). ~<Sindri~>: the great worker in gold among the dwarfs. ~<Okolnir~>]",
					
					"38. A hall I saw, | far from the sun,\nOn Nastrond it stands, | and the doors face north,\nVenom drops | through the smoke-vent down,\nFor around the walls | do serpents wind.\n\n39. I saw there wading | through rivers wild\nTreacherous men | and murderers too,\nAnd workers of ill | with the wives of men;\nThere Nithhogg sucked | the blood of the slain,\nAnd the wolf tore men; | would you know yet more?\n\n[(\"the Not Cold\"): possibly a volcano. ~<Brimir~>: the giant (possibly Ymir) out of whose blood, according to stanza 9, the dwarfs were made; the name here appears to mean simply the leader of the dwarfs.\n\n38. Stanzas 38 and 39 follow stanza 43 in the ~<Hauksbok~> version. Snorri quotes stanzas 39, 39, 40 and 41, though not consecutively. ~<Nastrond~> (\"Corpse-Strand\"): the land of the dead, ruled by the goddess Hel. Here the wicked undergo tortures. ~<Smoke~> ~<vent~>: the phrase gives a picture of the Icelandic house, with its opening in the roof serving instead of a chimney.\n\n39. The stanza is almost certainly in corrupt form. The third line is presumably an interpolation, and is lacking in most of the late, paper manuscripts. Some editors, however, have called lines 1-3 the remains of a full. stanza, with the fourth line lacking, and lines 4-5 the remains of another. The stanza depicts the torments of the two worst classes of criminals known to Old Norse morality--oath-breakers and murderers. ~<Nithhogg~> (\"the Dread Biter\"): the dragon that lies beneath the ash Yggdrasil and gnaws at its roots, thus symbolizing the destructive elements in the universe; cf. ~<Grimnismol~>, 32, 35. ~<The wolf~>: presumably the wolf Fenrir, one of the children of Loki and the giantess Angrbotha (the others being Mithgarthsorm and the goddess Hel), who was chained by the gods with the marvelous chain Gleipnir, fashioned by a dwarf \"out of six things: the]",

The ~<Hauksbok~> version inserts after stanza 39 the refrain stanza (44), and puts stanzas 40 and 41 between 27 and 21. With this stanza begins the account of the final struggle itself. ~<The giantess~>: her name is nowhere stated, and the only other reference to Ironwood is in ~<Grimnismol~>, 39, in this same connection. The children of this giantess and the wolf Fenrir are the wolves Skoll and Hati, the first of whom steals the sun, the second the moon. Some scholars naturally see here an eclipse myth.\n\n41. In the third line many editors omit the comma after \"sun,\" and put one after \"soon,\" making the two lines run: \"Dark grows the sun | in summer soon, / Mighty storms--\" etc. Either phenomenon in summer would be sufficiently striking.\n\n42. In the ~<Hauksbok~> version stanzas 42 and 43 stand between stanzas 44 and 38. ~<Eggther~>: this giant, who seems to be the watchman of the giants, as Heimdall is that of the gods and Surt of the dwellers in the fire-world, is not mentioned elsewhere in]",

This is a refrain-stanza. In ~<Regius~> it appears in full only at this point, but is repeated in abbreviated form before stanzas 50 and 59. In the ~<Hauksbok~> version the full stanza comes first between stanzas 35 and 42, then, in abbreviated form, it occurs four times: before stanzas 45, 50, 55, and 59. In the ~<Hauksbok~> line 3 runs: \"Farther I see and more can say.\" ~<Garm~>: the dog who guards the gates of Hel's kingdom; cf. Baldrs Draumar, 2 ff., and ~<Grimnismol~>, 44. ~<Gniparhellir~> (\"the Cliff-Cave\"): the entrance to the world of the dead. ~<The~> ~<wolf~>: Fenrir; cf. stanza 39 and note.\n\n45. From this point on through stanza 57 the poem is quoted by Snorri, stanza 49 alone being omitted. There has been much discussion as to the status of stanza 45. Lines 4 and 5 look like an interpolation. After line 5 the ~<Hauksbok~> has a line running: \"The world resounds, the witch is flying.\" Editors have arranged these seven lines in various ways, with lacunae freely indicated. ~<Sisters'~> ~<sons~>: in all Germanic countries the relations between uncle and nephew were felt to be particularly close.]",

This stanza refers to the story that he was sent by the gods with Hönir as a hostage to the Wanes after their war (cf. stanza 21 and note), and that the Wanes cut off his head and returned it to the gods. Othin embalmed the head, and by magic gave it the power of speech, thus making Mimir's noted wisdom always available. of course this story does not fit with that underlying the references to Mimir in stanzas 27 and 29. ~<The~> ~<kinsman~> ~<of~> ~<Surt~>: the wolf]",

As quoted by Snorri the first line of this stanza runs: \"Fares Othin's son | to fight with the wolf.\" ~<Sigfather~> (\"Father of Victory\"): Othin. His son, Vithar, is the silent god, famed chiefly for his great shield, and his strength, which is little less than Thor's. He survives the destruction. ~<The~> ~<giant's~> ~<son~>: Fenrir.\n\n55.

Line I does not appear in the ~<Hauksbok~> version, the stanza there beginning with line 2. Snorri, in quoting these two stanzas, omits 55, 2-4, and 56, 3, making a single stanza out of 55, I, and 56, 4, 2, I, in that order. Moreover, the ~<Hauksbok~> manuscript at this point is practically illegible. The lacuna (line 3) is, of course, purely conjectural, and all sorts of arrangements of the lines have been attempted by editors, ~<Hlothyn~>: another name for Jorth (\"Earth\"), Thor's mother; his father was Othin. ~<The snake~>: Mithgarthsorm; cf. stanza 5c and note. ~<Othin's~> ~<son~>: Thor. The fourth line in ~<Regius~> reads \"against the wolf,\" but if this line refers to Thor at all, and not to Vithar, the ~<Hauksbok~> reading, \"serpent,\" is correct.\n\n56. ~<The~> ~<warder~> ~<of~> ~<earth~>: Thor. ~<The~> ~<son~> ~<of~> ~<Fjorgyn~>: again]",

With this stanza ends the account of the destruction.\n\n58. Again the refrain-stanza (cf. stanza 44 and note), abbreviated in both manuscripts, as in the case of stanza 49. It is probably misplaced here.\n\n59. Here begins the description of the new world which is to rise out of the wreck of the old one. It is on this passage that a few critics have sought to base their argument that the poem is later than the introduction of Christianity (circa 1000), but this theory has never seemed convincing (cf. introductory note).\n\n60.

This stanza is quoted by Snorri. ~<Gimle~>: Snorri makes this the name of the hall itself, while here it appears to refer to a mountain on which the hall stands. It is the home of the happy, as opposed to another hall, not here mentioned, for the dead. Snorri's description of this second hall is based on ~<Voluspo~>, 38, which he quotes, and perhaps that stanza properly belongs after 64.\n\n65. This stanza is not found in ~<Regius~>, and is probably spurious. No lacuna is indicated in the ~<Hauksbok~> version, but late paper manuscripts add two lines, running:\n\n\t\t\"Rule he orders, | and rights he fixes,\n\t\tLaws he ordains | that ever shall live.\"\n\nThe name of this new ruler is nowhere given, and of course the suggestion of Christianity is unavoidable.

Presumably the stanza (barring the last half-line, which was probably intended as the conclusion of the poem) belongs somewhere in the description of the great struggle. ~<Nithhogg~>: the dragon at the roots of Yggdrasil; cf. stanza 39 and note. ~<Nithafjoll~> (\"the Dark Crags\"); nowhere else mentioned. ~<Must~> ~<I~>: the manuscripts have \"must she.\"]"

					"~<Hovamol~>\n\n~<The Ballad of the High One~>\n\n~<Introductory Note~>\n\nThis poem follows the ~<Voluspo~> in the ~<Codex~> ~<Regius~>, but is preserved in no other manuscript. The first stanza is quoted by Snorri, and two lines of stanza 84 appear in one of the sagas.\n\nIn its present shape it involves the critic of the text in more puzzles than any other of the Eddic poems. Without going in detail into the various theories, what happened seems to have been somewhat as follows. There existed from very early times a collection of proverbs and wise counsels, which were attributed to Othin just as the Biblical proverbs were to Solomon. This collection, which presumably was always elastic in extent, was known as \"The High One's Words,\" and forms the basis of the present poem. To it, however, were added other poems and fragments dealing with wisdom which seemed by their nature to imply that the speaker was Othin. Thus a catalogue of runes, or charms, was tacked on, and also a set of proverbs, differing essentially in form from those comprising the main collection. Here and there bits of verse more nearly narrative crept in; and of course the loose structure of the poem made it easy for any reciter to insert new stanzas almost at will. This curious miscellany is what we now have as the ~<Hovamol~>.\n\nFive separate elements are pretty clearly recognizable: (1) the ~<Hovamol~> proper (stanzas 1-80), a collection of proverbs and counsels for the conduct of life; (2) the ~<Loddfafnismol~> (stanzas 111-138), a collection somewhat similar to the first, but specific ally addressed to a certain Loddfafnir; (3) the ~<Ljothatal~> (stanzas 147-165), a collection of charms; (4) the love-story of Othin and Billing's daughter (stanzas 96-102), with an introductory dissertation on the faithlessness of women in general (stanzas 81-95), which probably crept into the poem first, and then pulled the story, as an apt illustration, after it; (5) the story of how Othin got the mead of poetry--the draught which gave him the gift of tongues--from the maiden Gunnloth (stanzas 103-110). There is also a brief passage (stanzas 139 146) telling how Othin won the runes, this passage being a natural introduction to the ~<Ljothatal~>, and doubtless brought into the poem for that reason.",
					
					"It is idle to discuss the authorship or date of such a series of accretions as this. Parts of it are doubtless among the oldest relics of ancient Germanic poetry; parts of it may have originated at a relatively late period. Probably, however, most of its component elements go pretty far back, although we have no way of telling how or when they first became associated.\n\nIt seems all but meaningless to talk about \"interpolations\" in a poem which has developed almost solely through the process of piecing together originally unrelated odds and ends. The notes, therefore, make only such suggestions as are needed to keep the main divisions of the poem distinct.\n\nFew gnomic collections in the world's literary history present sounder wisdom more tersely expressed than the Hovamol. Like the Book of Proverbs it occasionally rises to lofty heights of poetry. If it presents the worldly wisdom of a violent race, it also shows noble ideals of loyalty, truth, and unfaltering courage.\n\n1.

This stanza is quoted by Snorri, the second line being omitted in most of the ~<Prose~> ~<Edda~> manuscripts.\n\n2.

The two lines of stanza 73 not only appear out of place, but the verse form is unlike that of the surrounding stanzas. In 74, the second line is clearly interpolated, and line I has little enough connection with lines 3, 4 and 5. It looks as though some compiler (or copyist) had inserted here various odds and ends for which he could find no better place.\n\n75. The word \"gold\" in line 2 is more or less conjectural, the manuscript being obscure. The reading in line 4 is also doubtful.]",

This stanza is certainly in bad shape, and probably out of place here. Its reference to runes as magic signs suggests that it properly belongs in some list of charms like the ~<Ljothatal~> (stanzas 147-165). The stanza-form is so irregular as to show either that something has been lost or that there have been interpolations. The manuscript indicates no lacuna; Gering fills out the assumed gap as follows:\n\n\t\t\"Certain is that which is sought from runes,\n\t\tThe runes--,\" etc.\n]",

With this stanza the verse-form, as indicated in the translation, abruptly changes to Malahattr. What has happened seems to have been something like this. Stanza 80 introduces the idea of man's love for woman. Consequently some reciter or compiler (or possibly even a copyist) took occasion to insert at this point certain stanzas concerning the ways of women. Thus stanza 80 would account for the introduction of stanzas 81 and 82, which, in turn, apparently drew stanza 83 in with them. Stanza 84 suggests the fickleness of women, and is immediately followed--again with a change of verse-form--by a list of things equally untrustworthy (stanzas 85-90). Then, after a few more stanzas on love in the regular measure of the ~<Hovamol~> (stanza 91-9s), is introduced, by way of illustration, Othin's story of his]",

Some such process of growth, whatever its specific stages may have been, must be assumed to account for the curious chaos of the whole passage from stanza 81 to stanza 102.\n\n84. Lines 3 and 4 are quoted in the ~<Fostbræthrasaga~>.\n\n85. Stanzas 85-88 and go are in Fornyrthislag, and clearly come from a different source from the rest of the ~<Hovamol~>.\n\n87. The stanza is doubtless incomplete. Some editors add from a late paper manuscript two lines running: \"In a light, clear sky | or a laughing throng, / In the bowl of a dog | or a harlot's grief!\"]", -- had to condense verses in the footnotes into a single line

This stanza follows stanza 89 in the manuscript. Many editors have changed the order, for while stanza 89 is pretty clearly an interpolation wherever it stands, it seriously interferes with the sense if it breaks in between 87 and 88.]",

Of this person we know nothing beyond what is here told, but the story needs little comment.]",

Rask adds at the beginning of this stanza two lines from a late paper manuscript, running:\n\n\"Few are so good | that false they are never\nTo cheat the mind of a man.\"\n\nHe makes these two lines plus lines I and 2 a full stanza, and line 3, 4, 5, and 6 a second stanza.]",

The mouth of Rati | made room for my passage,\nAnd space in the stone he gnawed;\n\n[103. With this stanza the subject changes abruptly, and apparently the virtues of fair speech, mentioned in the last three lines, account for the introduction, from what source cannot be known, of the story of Othin and the mead of song (stanzas 104-110).\n\n104. The giant ~<Suttung~> (\"the old giant\") possessed the magic mead, a draught of which conferred the gift of poetry. Othin, desiring to obtain it, changed himself into a snake, bored his way through a mountain into Suttung's home, made love to the giant's daughter, Gunnloth, and by her connivance drank up all the mead. Then he flew away in the form of an eagle, leaving Gunnloth to her fate. While with Suttung he assumed the name of Bolverk (\"the Evil-Doer\").\n\n105. ~<Rati~> (\"the Traveller\"): the gimlet with which Othin bored through the mountain to reach Suttung's home.]",

					"Above and below | the giants' paths lay,\nSo rashly I risked my head.\n\n106. Gunnloth gave | on a golden stool\nA drink of the marvelous mead;\nA harsh reward | did I let her have\nFor her heroic heart,\nAnd her spirit troubled sore.\n\n107. The well-earned beauty | well I enjoyed,\nLittle the wise man lacks;\nSo Othrörir now | has up been brought\nTo the midst of the men of earth.\n\n108. Hardly, methinks, | would I home have come,\nAnd left the giants' land,\nHad not Gunnloth helped me, | the maiden good,\nWhose arms about me had been.\n\n109. The day that followed, | the frost-giants came,\nSome word of Hor to win,\n(And into the hall of Hor;)\n\n[106. Probably either the fourth or the fifth line is a spurious addition.\n\n107. ~<Othrörir~>: here the name of the magic mead itself, whereas in stanza 141 it is the name of the vessel containing it. Othin had no intention of bestowing any of the precious mead upon men, but as he was flying over the earth, hotly pursued by Suttung, he spilled some of it out of his mouth, and in this way mankind also won the gift of poetry.\n\n108. ~<Hor~>: Othin (\"the High One\"). The frost-giants, Suttung's kinsmen, appear not to have suspected Othin of being]",

					"Of Bolverk they asked, | were he back midst the gods,\nOr had Suttung slain him there?\n\n110. On his ring swore Othin | the oath, methinks;\nWho now his troth shall trust?\nSuttung's betrayal | he sought with drink,\nAnd Gunnloth to grief he left.\n\n~<* * *~>\n\n111. It is time to chant | from the chanter's stool;\nBy the wells of Urth I was,\nI saw and was silent, | I saw and thought,\nAnd heard the speech of Hor.\n(Of runes heard I words, | nor were counsels wanting,\nAt the hall of Hor,\nIn the hall of Hor;\nSuch was the speech I heard.)\n\n[identical with Bolverk, possibly because the oath referred to in stanza I to was an oath made by Othin to Suttung that there was no such person as Bolverk among the gods. The giants, of course, fail to get from Othin the information they seek concerning Bolverk, but Othin is keenly conscious of having violated the most sacred of oaths, that sworn on his ring.\n\n111. With this stanza begins the Loddfafnismol (stanzas 111-138). Loddfafnir is apparently a wandering singer, who, from his \"chanter's stool,\" recites the verses which he claims to have received from Othin. ~<Wells of Urth~>: cf. ~<Voluspo~>, 19 and note. Urth (\"the Past\") is one of the three Norns. This stanza is apparently in corrupt form, and editors have tried many experiments with it, both in rejecting lines as spurious and in rearranging the words and punctuation. It looks rather as though the first four lines formed a complete stanza, and the last four had crept in later. The phrase translated \"the speech of Hor\" is \"Hova mol,\" later used as the title for the entire poem.]",

The material is closely analogous to that contained in the first eighty stanzas of the poem.

This stanza suggests the dangers of too much hospitality. The beam (bolt) which is ever being raised to admit guests be comes weak thereby. It needs a ring to help it in keeping the door closed, and without the ability at times to ward off guests a man becomes the victim of his own generosity.\n\n137. The list of \"household remedies\" in this stanza is doubtless interpolated. Their nature needs no comment here.]",

In the manuscript this stanza comes at the end of the entire poem, following stanza 165. Most recent editors have followed Müllenhoff in shifting it to this position, as it appears to conclude the passage introduced by the somewhat similar stanza 111.\n\n139. With this stanza begins the most confusing part of the ~<Hovamol~>: the group of eight stanzas leading up to the Ljothatal, or list of charms. Certain paper manuscripts have before this stanza a title: \"Othin's Tale of the Runes.\" Apparently stanzas 139, 140 and 142 are fragments of an account of how Othin obtained the runes; 141 is erroneously inserted from some version of the magic mead story (cf. stanzas 104-110); and stanzas 143, 144, 145, and 146 are from miscellaneous sources, all, however, dealing with the general subject of runes. With stanza 147 a clearly continuous passage begins once more. ~<The windy tree~>: the ash Yggdrasil (literally \"the Horse of Othin,\" so called be cause of this story), on which Othin, in order to win the magic runes, hanged himself as an offering to himself, and wounded himself with his own spear. Lines 5 and 6 have presumably been borrowed from ~<Svipdagsmol~>, 30.]",

					"140. None made me happy | with loaf or horn,\nAnd there below I looked;\nI took up the runes, | shrieking I took them,\nAnd forthwith back I fell.\n\n141. Nine mighty songs | I got from the son\nOf Bolthorn, Bestla's father;\nAnd a drink I got | of the goodly mead\nPoured out from Othrörir.\n\n142. Then began I to thrive, | and wisdom to get,\nI grew and well I was;\nEach word led me on | to another word,\nEach deed to another deed.\n\n143. Runes shalt thou find, | and fateful signs,\nThat the king of singers colored,\nAnd the mighty gods have made;\n\n[141. This stanza, interrupting as it does the account of Othin's winning the runes, appears to be an interpolation. The meaning of the stanza is most obscure. Bolthorn was Othin's grandfather, and Bestla his mother. We do not know the name of the uncle here mentioned, but it has been suggested that this son of Bolthorn was Mimir (cf. ~<Voluspo~>, 27 and note, and 47 and note). In any case, the nine magic songs which he learned from his uncle seem to have enabled him to win the magic mead (cf. stanzas 104-110). Concerning ~<Othrörir~>, here used as the name of the vessel containing the mead, cf. stanza 107 and note.\n\n143. This and the following stanza belong together, and in many editions appear as a single stanza. They presumably come from some lost poem on the authorship of the runes. Lines 2 and 3 follow line 4 in the manuscript; the transposition was suggested by Bugge. ~<The~> ~<king~> ~<of~> ~<singers~>: Othin. The magic signs (runes) were commonly carved in wood, then colored red.]",

Dain, however, may here be one of the elves rather than the dwarf of that name. The two names also appear together in ~<Grimnismol~>, 33, where they are applied to two of the four harts that nibble at the topmost twigs of Yggdrasil. ~<Alsvith~> (\"the All Wise\") appears nowhere else as a giant's name. ~<Myself~>: Othin. We have no further information concerning the list of those who wrote the runes for the various races, and these four lines seem like a confusion of names in the rather hazy mind of some reciter.\n\n145. This Malahattr stanza appears to be a regular religious formula, concerned less with the runes which one \"writes\" and \"tints\" (cf. stanza 79) than with the prayers which one \"asks\" and the sacrifices which one \"offers\" and \"sends.\" Its origin is wholly uncertain, but it is clearly an interpolation here. In the manuscript the phrase \"knowest?\" is abbreviated after the first line.]",

This stanza as translated here follows the manuscript reading, except in assuming a gap between lines 3 and 5. In Vigfusson and Powell's ~<Corpus~> ~<Poeticum~> ~<Boreale~> the first three lines have somehow been expanded into eight. The last two lines are almost certainly misplaced; Bugge suggests that they belong at the end of stanza 144. ~<Thund~>: another name for Othin. ~<When~> ~<home~> ~<he~> ~<came~>: presumably after obtaining the runes as described in stanzas 139 and 140.\n\n147. With this stanza begins the ~<Ljothatal~>, or list of charms. The magic songs themselves are not given, but in each case the peculiar application of the charm is explained. The passage, which is certainly approximately complete as far as it goes, runs to the end of the poem. In the manuscript and in most editions line 4 falls into two half-lines, running:\n\n\"In sickness and pain | and every sorrow.\"\n]",

The sprinkling of a child with water was an established custom long before Christianity brought its conception of baptism.\n\n161. This stanza, according to Müllenhoff, was the original conclusion of the poem, the phrase \"a fifteenth\" being inserted only after stanzas 162-165 had crept in. ~<Delling~>: a seldom mentioned god who married Not (Night). Their son was Dag (Day). ~<Thjothrörir~>: not mentioned elsewhere. ~<Hroptatyr~>: Othin.]",

Some editors have combined these two lines with stanza 164. Others have assumed that the gap follows the first half-line, making \"so that-from me\" the end of the stanza.\n\n164. This stanza is almost certainly an interpolation, and seems to have been introduced after the list of charms and the ~<Loddfafnismol~> (stanzas 111-138) were combined in a single poem, for there is no other apparent excuse for the reference to Loddfafnir at this point. The words \"if thou mightest get them\" are a conjectural emendation.\n\n165. This stanza is almost totally obscure. The third and fourth lines look like interpolations.]"

					"~<Vafthruthnismol~>\n\n~<The Ballad of Vafthruthnir~>\n\n~<Introductory Note~>\n\nThe Vafthruthnismol follows the Hovamol in the ~<Codex~> ~<Regius~>. From stanza 20 on it is also included in the ~<Arnamagnæan~> ~<Codex~>, the first part evidently having appeared on leaf now lost. Snorri quotes eight stanzas of it in the ~<Prose~> ~<Edda~>, and in his prose text closely paraphrases many others.\n\nThe poem is wholly in dialogue form except for a single narrative stanza (stanza 5). After a brief introductory discussion between Othin and his wife, Frigg, concerning the reputed wisdom of the giant Vafthruthnir, Othin, always in quest of wisdom, seeks out the giant, calling himself Gagnrath. The giant immediately insists that they shall demonstrate which is the wiser of the two, and propounds four questions (stanzas 11, 13, 15, and 17), each of which Othin answers. It is then the god's turn to ask, and he begins with a series of twelve numbered questions regarding the origins and past history of life. These Vafthruthnir answers, and Othin asks five more questions, this time referring to what is to follow the destruction of the gods, the last one asking the name of his own slayer. Again Vafthruthnir answers, and Othin finally propounds the unanswerable question: \"What spake Othin himself in the ears of his son, ere in the bale-fire he burned?\" Vafthruthnir, recognizing his questioner as Othin himself, admits his inferiority in wisdom, and so the contest ends.\n\nThe whole poem is essentially encyclopædic in character, and thus was particularly useful to Snorri in his preparation of the ~<Prose~> ~<Edda~>. The encyclopædic poem with a slight narrative outline seems to have been exceedingly popular; the ~<Grimnismol~> and the much later ~<Alvissmol~> represent different phases of the same type. The ~<Vafthruthnismol~> and ~<Grimnismol~> together, in deed, constitute a fairly complete dictionary of Norse mythology. There has been much discussion as to the probable date of the ~<Vafthruthnismol~>, but it appears to belong to about the same period as the ~<Voluspo~>: in other words, the middle of the tenth century. While there may be a few interpolated passages in the poem as we now have it, it is clearly a united whole, and evidently in relatively good condition.",

Snorri gives, without materially elaborating on it, the same account of how Ymir's son and daughter were born under his left arm, and how his feet together created a son. That this offspring should have had six heads is nothing out of the ordinary, for various giants had more than the normal number, and Ymir's mother is credited with a little matter of nine hundred heads; cf. ~<Hymiskvitha~>, 8. Of the career of Ymir's six headed son we know nothing; he may have been the Thruthgelmir of stanza 29.]",

					"~<Grimnismol~>\n\n~<The Ballad of Grimnir~>\n\n~<Introductory Note~>\n\nThe ~<Grimnismol~> follows the ~<Vafthruthnismol~> in the ~<Codex~> ~<Regius~> and is also found complete in the ~<Arnamagnæan~> ~<Codex~>, where also it follows the ~<Vafthruthnismol~>. Snorri quotes over twenty of its stanzas.\n\nLike the preceding poem, the ~<Grimnismol~> is largely encyclopedic in nature, and consists chiefly of proper names, the last forty-seven stanzas containing no less than two hundred and twenty-five of these. It is not, however, in dialogue form. As Müllenhoff pointed out, there is underneath the catalogue of mythological names a consecutive and thoroughly dramatic story. Othin, concealed under the name of Grimnir, is through an error tortured by King Geirröth. Bound between two blazing fires, he begins to display his wisdom for the benefit of the king's little son, Agnar, who has been kind to him. Gradually he works up to the great final moment, when he declares his true name, or rather names, to the terrified Geirröth, and the latter falls on his sward and is killed.\n\nFor much of this story we do not have to depend on guesswork, for in both manuscripts the poem itself is preceded by a prose narrative of considerable length, and concluded by a brief prose statement of the manner of Geirröth's death. These prose notes, of which there are many in the Eddic manuscripts, are of considerable interest to the student of early literary forms. Presumably they were written by the compiler to whom we owe the Eddic collection, who felt that the poems needed such annotation in order to be clear. Linguistic evidence shows that they were written in the twelfth or thirteenth century, for they preserve none of the older word-forms which help us to date many of the poems two or three hundred years earlier.\n\nWithout discussing in detail the problems suggested by these prose passages, it is worth noting, first, that the Eddic poems contain relatively few stanzas of truly narrative verse; and second, that all of them are based on narratives which must have been more or less familiar to the hearers of the poems. In other words, the poems seldom aimed to tell stories, although most of them followed a narrative sequence of ideas. The stories",
					
					"themselves appear to have lived in oral prose tradition, just as in the case of the sagas; and the prose notes of the manuscripts, in so far as they contain material not simply drawn from the poems themselves, are relics of this tradition. The early Norse poets rarely conceived verse as a suitable means for direct story telling, and in some of the poems even the simplest action is told in prose \"links\" between dialogue stanzas.\n\nThe applications of this fact, which has been too often over looked, are almost limitless, for it suggests a still unwritten chapter in the history of ballad poetry and the so-called \"popular\" epic. It implies that narrative among early peoples may frequently have had a period of prose existence before it was made into verse, and thus puts, for example, a long series of transitional stages before such a poem as the ~<Iliad~>. In any case, the prose notes accompanying the Eddic poems prove that in addition to the poems themselves there existed in the twelfth century a considerable amount of narrative tradition, presumably in prose form, on which these notes were based by the compiler.\n\nInterpolations in such a poem as the ~<Grimnismol~> could have been made easily enough, and many stanzas have undoubtedly crept in from other poems, but the beginning and end of the poem are clearly marked, and presumably it has come down to us with the same essential outline it had when it was composed, probably in the first half of the tenth century.\n\nKing Hrauthung had two sons: one was called Agnar, and the other Geirröth. Agnar was ten winters old, and Geirröth eight. Once they both rowed in a boat with their fishing-gear to catch little fish; and the wind drove them out into the sea. In the darkness of the night they were wrecked on the shore; and going up, they found a poor peasant, with whom they stayed through the winter. The housewife took care of Agnar, and the peasant cared for\n\n[Prose. The texts of the two manuscripts differ in many minor details. ~<Hrauthung~>: this mythical king is not mentioned elsewhere. ~<Geirröth~>: the manuscripts spell his name in various ways]",
					
					"Geirröth, and taught him wisdom. In the spring the peasant gave him a boat; and when the couple led them to the shore, the peasant spoke secretly with Geirröth. They had a fair wind, and came to their father's landing-place. Geirröth was forward in the boat; he leaped up on land, but pushed out the boat and said, \"Go thou now where evil may have thee!\" The boat drifted out to sea. Geirröth, however, went up to the house, and was well received, but his father was dead. Then Geirröth was made king, and became a renowned man.\n\nOthin and Frigg sat in Hlithskjolf and looked over all the worlds. Othin said: \"Seest thou Agnar, thy fosterling, how he begets children with a giantess in the cave? But Geirröth, my fosterling, is a king, and now rules over his land.\" Frigg said: \"He is so miserly that he tortures his guests if he thinks that too many of them come to him.\" Othin replied that this was the greatest of lies; and they made a wager about this matter. Frigg sent her maid-servant, Fulla, to Geirröth. She bade the king beware lest a magician who was come thither to his land should bewitch him, and told this sign concerning him, that no dog was so fierce as to leap at him. Now it was a very great slander that King Geirröth was not hospitable; but nevertheless he had them take the man whom the dogs would not attack. He wore a dark-blue mantle and called himself Grimnir, but said no more about himself, though\n\n[~<Frigg~>: Othin's wife. She and Othin nearly always disagreed in some such way as the one outlined in this story. ~<Hlithskjolf~> (\"Gate-Shelf\"): Othin's watch-tower in heaven, whence he can overlook all the nine worlds; cf. ~<Skirnismol~>, introductory prose. ~<Grimnir~>: \"the Hooded One.\"]",
					
					"he was questioned. The king had him tortured to make him speak, and set him between two fires, and he sat there eight nights. King Geirröth had a son ten winters old, and called Agnar after his father's brother. Agnar went to Grimnir, and gave him a full horn to drink from, and said that the king did ill in letting him be tormented with out cause. Grimnir drank from the horn; the fire had come so near that the mantle burned on Grimnir's back. He spake:\n\n1. Hot art thou, fire! | too fierce by far;\nGet ye now gone, ye flames!\nThe mantle is burnt, | though I bear it aloft,\nAnd the fire scorches the fur.\n\n2. 'Twixt the fires now | eight nights have I sat,\nAnd no man brought meat to me,\nSave Agnar alone, | and alone shall rule\nGeirröth's son o'er the Goths.\n\n3. Hail to thee, Agnar! | for hailed thou art\nBy the voice of Veratyr;\n\n[2. In the original lines 2 and 4 are both too long for the meter, and thus the true form of the stanza is doubtful. For line 4 both manuscripts have \"the land of the Goths\" instead of simply \"the Goths.\" The word \"Goths\" apparently was applied indiscriminately to any South-Germanic people, including the Burgundians as well as the actual Goths, and thus here has no specific application; cf. ~<Gripisspo~>, 35 and note.]",

The god, or rather Wane, Njorth (cf. ~<Voluspo~>, 21, note) married Thjazi's daughter, Skathi. She wished to live in her father's hall among the mountains, while Njorth loved his home, Noatun, by the sea. They agreed to compromise by spending nine nights at Thrymheim and then three at Noatun, but neither could endure the surroundings of the other's home, so Skathi returned to Thrymheim, while Njorth stayed at Noatun.

In this stanza the two functions of Heimdall--as father of mankind (cf. ~<Voluspo~>, 1 and note, and ~<Rigsthula~>, introductory prose and note) and as warder of the gods--seem both to be mentioned, but the second line in the manuscripts is apparently in bad shape, and in the editions is more or less conjectural.\n\n14. ~<Folkvang~> (\"Field of the Folk): here is situated Freyja's]",

Freyja, the sister of Freyr, is the fairest of the goddesses, and the most kindly disposed to mankind, especially to lovers. ~<Half~> ~<of~> ~<the~> ~<dead~>: Mogk has made it clear that Freyja represents a confusion between two originally distinct divinities: the wife of Othin (Frigg) and the northern goddess of love. This passage appears to have in mind her attributes as Othin's wife. Snorri has this same confusion, but there is no reason why the Freyja who was Freyr's sister should share the slain with Othin.\n\n15. ~<Glitnir~> (\"the Shining\"): the home of Forseti, a god of whom we know nothing beyond what Snorri tells us: \"Forseti is the son of Baldr and Nanna, daughter of Nep. All those who come to him with hard cases to settle go away satisfied; he is the best judge among gods and men.\"\n\n16. ~<Noatun~> (\"Ships'-Haven\"): the home of Njorth, who calms the waves; cf. stanza 11 and ~<Voluspo~>, 21.\n\n17. ~<Vithi~>: this land is not mentioned elsewhere. ~<Vithar~> avenged his father, Othin, by slaying the wolf Fenrir.]",

Very possibly they are an interpolation here. ~<Eldhrimnir~> (\"Sooty with Fire\"): the great kettle in Valhall, wherein the gods' cook, ~<Andhrimnir~> (\"The Sooty-Faced\") daily cooks the flesh of the boar ~<Sæhrimnir~> (\"The Blackened\"). His flesh suffices for all the heroes there gathered, and each evening he becomes whole again, to be cooked the next morning.\n\n19. ~<Freki~> (\"The Greedy\") and ~<Geri~> (\"The Ravenous\"): the two wolves who sit by Othin's side at the feast, and to whom he gives all the food set before him, since wine is food and drink alike for him. ~<Heerfather~>: Othin. 20, ~<Mithgarth~> (\"The Middle Home\"): the earth. ~<Hugin~> (\"Thought\") and ~<Munin~> (\"Memory\"): the two ravens who sit on Othin's shoulders, and fly forth daily to bring him news of the world.]",

The last two lines refer to the attack on Valhall by the people of Hel; cf. Voluspo, 51.\n\n22. ~<Valgrind~> (\"The Death-Gate\"): the outer gate of Valhall; cf. ~<Sigurtharkvitha~> ~<en~> ~<skamma~>, 68 and note.\n\n23. This and the following stanza stand in reversed order in ~<Regius~>. Snorri quotes stanza 23 as a proof of the vast size of Valhall. The last two lines refer to the final battle with Fenrir and the other enemies.\n\n24. This stanza is almost certainly an interpolation, brought in through a confusion of the first two lines with those of stanza 23. Its description of Thor's house, Bilskirnir (cf. stanza 4 and]",

Snorri quotes the stanza in his account of Thor.\n\n25. The first line in the original is, as indicated in the translation, too long, and various attempts to amend it have been made. ~<Heithrun~>: the she-goat who lives on the twigs of the tree ~<Lærath~> (presumably the ash Yggdrasil), and daily gives mead which, like the boar's flesh, suffices for all the heroes in Valhall. In Snorri's ~<Edda~> Gangleri foolishly asks whether the heroes drink water, whereto Har replies, \"Do you imagine that Othin invites kings and earls and other noble men, and then gives them water to drink?\"\n\n26. Eikthyrnir (\"The Oak-Thorned,\" i.e., with antlers, \"thorns,\" like an oak): this animal presumably represents the clouds. The first line, like that of stanza 25, is too long in the original. ~<Lærath~>: cf. stanza 25, note. ~<Hvergelmir~>: according to Snorri, this spring, \"the Cauldron-Roaring,\" was in the midst of Niflheim, the world of darkness and the dead, beneath the third root of the ash Yggdrasil. Snorri gives a list of the rivers flowing thence nearly identical with the one in the poem.]",

The entire passage from stanza 27 through stanza 35 is confused. The whole thing may well be an interpolation. Bugge calls stanzas 27-30 an interpolation, and editors who have accepted the passage as a whole have rejected various lines. The spelling of the names of the rivers varies greatly in the manuscripts and editions. It is needless here to point out the many attempted emendations of this list. For a passage presenting similar problems, cf. ~<Voluspo~>, 10-16. Snorri virtually quotes stanzas 27-29 in his prose, though not consecutively. The name ~<Rin~>, in line 3, is identical with that for the River Rhine which appears frequently in the hero poems, but the similarity is doubt less purely accidental.\n\n28. ~<Slith~> may possibly be the same river as that mentioned in Voluspo, 36, as flowing through the giants' land. ~<Leipt~>: in ~<Helgakvitha~> ~<Hundingsbana~> ~<II~>, 29, this river is mentioned as one by which a solemn oath is sworn, and Gering points the parallel to the significance of the Styx among the Greeks. The other rivers here named are not mentioned elsewhere in the poems.]",
					
					"29. Kormt and Ormt | and the Kerlaugs twain\nShall Thor each day wade through,\n(When dooms to give | he forth shall go\nTo the ash-tree Yggdrasil;)\nFor heaven's bridge | burns all in flame,\nAnd the sacred waters seethe.\n\n30. Glath and Gyllir, | Gler and Skeithbrimir,\nSilfrintopp and Sinir,\nGisl and Falhofnir, | Golltopp and Lettfeti,\nOn these steeds the gods shall go\nWhen dooms to give | each day they ride\nTo the ash-tree Yggdrasil.\n\n[29. This stanza looks as though it originally had had nothing to do with the two preceding it. Snorri quotes it in his description of the three roots of Yggdrasil, and the three springs be neath them. \"The third root of the ash stands in heaven and beneath this root is a spring which is very holy, and is called Urth's well.\" (Cf. ~<Voluspo~>, 19) \"There the gods have their judgment-seat, and thither they ride each day over Bifrost, which is also called the Gods' Bridge.\" Thor has to go on foot in the last days of the destruction, when the bridge is burning. Another interpretation, however, is that when Thor leaves the heavens (i.e., when a thunder-storm is over) the rainbow-bridge becomes hot in the sun. Nothing more is known of the rivers named in this stanza. Lines 3-4 are almost certainly interpolated from stanza 30.\n\n30. This stanza, again possibly an interpolation, is closely paraphrased by Snorri following the passage quoted in the previous note. ~<Glath~> (\"Joyous\"): identified in the ~<Skaldskaparmal~> with Skinfaxi, the horse of day; cf. ~<Vafthruthnismol~>, 12. ~<Gyllir~>: \"Golden.\" ~<Gler~>: \"Shining.\" ~<Skeithbrimir~>: \"Swift-Going.\" ~<Silfrintopp~>: \"Silver-Topped.\" Sinir: \"Sinewy.\" ~<Gisl~>: the meaning is doubtful; Gering suggests \"Gleaming.\" ~<Falhofnir~>:]",
					
					"31. Three roots there are | that three ways run\n'Neath the ash-tree Yggdrasil;\n'Neath the first lives Hel, | 'neath the second the frost-giants,\n'Neath the last are the lands of men.\n\n32. Ratatosk is the squirrel | who there shall run\nOn the ash-tree Yggdrasil;\nFrom above the words | of the eagle he bears,\nAnd tells them to Nithhogg beneath.\n\n33. Four harts there are, | that the highest twigs\n\n[\"Hollow-Hoofed.\" ~<Golltopp~> (\"Gold-Topped\"): this horse be longed to Heimdall (cf. Voluspo, i and 46). It is noteworthy that gold was one of the attributes of Heimdall's belongings, and, because his teeth were of gold, he was also called Gullintanni (\"Gold-Toothed\"). ~<Lettfeti~>: \"Light-Feet.\" Othin's eight footed horse, ~<Sleipnir~>, is not mentioned in this list.\n\n31. The first of these roots is the one referred to in stanza 26; the second in stanza 29 (cf. notes). Of the third root there is nothing noteworthy recorded. After this stanza it is more than possible that one has been lost, paraphrased in the prose of Snorri's Edda thus: \"An eagle sits in the branches of the ash tree, and he is very wise; and between his eyes sits the hawk who is called Vethrfolnir.\"\n\n32. ~<Ratatosk~> (\"The Swift-Tusked\"): concerning this squirrel, the Prose Edda has to add only that he runs up and down the tree conveying the abusive language of the eagle (see note on stanza 31) and the dragon ~<Nithhogg~> (cf. ~<Voluspo~>, 39 and note) to each other. The hypothesis that Ratatosk \"represents the undying hatred between the sustaining and the destroying elements-the gods and the giants,\" seems a trifle far-fetched.\n\n33. Stanzas 33-34 may well be interpolated, and are certainly in bad shape in the Mss. Bugge points out that they are probably of later origin than those surrounding them. Snorri]",

Yggdrasil's ash | great evil suffers,\nFar more than men do know;\n\n[closely paraphrases stanza 33, but without elaboration, and nothing further is known of the ~<four~> ~<harts~>. It may be guessed, however, that they are a late multiplication of the single hart mentioned in stanza 26, just as the list of dragons in stanza 34 seems to have been expanded out of Nithhogg, the only authentic dragon under the root of the ash. ~<Highest~> ~<twigs~>: a guess; the Mss. words are baffling. Something has apparently been lost from lines 3-4, but there is no clue as to its nature.\n\n34. Cf. note on previous stanza. Nothing further is known of any of the serpents here listed, and the meanings of many of the names are conjectural. Snorri quotes this stanza. Editors have altered it in various ways in an attempt to regularize the meter. ~<Goin~> and ~<Moin~>: meaning obscure. ~<Grafvitnir~>: \"The Gnawing Wolf.\" ~<Grabak~>: \"Gray-Back.\" ~<Grafvolluth~>: \"The Field Gnawer.\" ~<Ofnir~> and ~<Svafnir~> (\"The Bewilderer\" and \"The Sleep-Bringer\"): it is noteworthy that in stanza 54 Othin gives himself these two names.\n\n35. Snorri quotes this stanza, which concludes the passage, beginning with stanza 25, describing Yggdrasil. If we assume that stanzas 27-34 are later interpolations--possibly excepting 32--this section of the poem reads clearly enough.]",
					
					"The hart bites its top, | its trunk is rotting,\nAnd Nithhogg gnaws beneath.\n\n36.

Arvak and Alsvith | up shall drag\nWeary the weight of the sun;\nBut an iron cool | have the kindly gods\nOf yore set under their yokes.\n\n[36. Snorri quotes this list of the Valkyries, concerning whom cf. Voluspo, 31 and note, where a different list of names is given. ~<Hrist~>: \"Shaker.\" ~<Mist~>: \"Mist.\" ~<Skeggjold~>: \"Ax-Time.\" ~<Skogul~>: \"Raging\" (?). ~<Hild~>: \"Warrior.\" ~<Thruth~>: \"Might.\" ~<Hlok~>: \"Shrieking.\" ~<Herfjotur~>: \"Host-Fetter.\" ~<Gol~>: \"Screaming.\" ~<Geironul~>: \"Spear-Bearer.\" ~<Randgrith~>: \"Shield-Bearer.\" ~<Rathgrith~>: Gering guesses \"Plan-Destroyer.\" ~<Reginleif~>: \"Gods'-Kin.\" Manuscripts and editions vary greatly in the spelling of these names, and hence in their significance.\n\n37. Müllenhoff suspects stanzas 37-41 to have been interpolated, and Edzardi thinks they may have come from the ~<Vafthruthnismol~>. Snorri closely paraphrases stanzas 37-39, and quotes 40-41. ~<Arvak~> (\"Early Waker\") and ~<Alsvith~> (\"All Swift\"): the horses of the sun, named also in ~<Sigrdrifumol~>, 15. According to Snorri: \"There was a man called Mundilfari, who had two children; they were so fair and lovely that he called his son Mani and his daughter Sol. The gods were angry at this presumption, and took the children and set them up in heaven; and they bade Sol drive the horses that drew the car of the sun]",
					
					"38. In front of the sun | does Svalin stand,\nThe shield for the shining god;\nMountains and sea | would be set in flames\nIf it fell from before the sun.\n\n39. Skoll is the wolf | that to Ironwood\nFollows the glittering god,\nAnd the son of Hrothvitnir, | Hati, awaits\nThe burning bride of heaven.\n\n40. Out of Ymir's flesh | was fashioned the earth,\nAnd the ocean out of his blood;\nOf his bones the hills, | of his hair the trees,\nOf his skull the heavens high.\n\n[which the gods had made to light the world from the sparks which flew out of Muspellsheim. The horses were called Alsvith and Arvak, and under their yokes the gods set two bellows to cool them, and in some songs these are called 'the cold iron.'\"\n\n38. ~<Svalin~> (\"The Cooling\"): the only other reference to this shield is in ~<Sigrdrifumol~>, 15.\n\n39. ~<Skoll~> and ~<Hati~>: the wolves that devour respectively the sun and moon. The latter is the son of Hrothvitnir (\"The Mighty Wolf,\" i. e. Fenrir); cf. ~<Voluspo~>, 40, and ~<Vafthruthnismol~>, 46-47, in which Fenrir appears as the thief. ~<Ironwood~>: a conjectural emendation of an obscure phrase; cf. ~<Voluspo~>, 40.\n\n40. This and the following stanza are quoted by Snorri. They seem to have come from a different source from the others of this poem; Edzardi suggests an older version of the ~<Vafthruthnismol~>. This stanza is closely parallel to ~<Vafthruthnismol~>, 21, which see, as also ~<Voluspo~>, 3. Snorri, following this account, has a few details to add. The stones were made out of Ymir's teeth and such of his bones as were broken. Mithgarth was a mountain-wall made out of Ymir's eyebrows, and set around the earth because of the enmity of the giants.]",
					
					"41. Mithgarth the gods | from his eyebrows made,\nAnd set for the sons of men;\nAnd out of his brain | the baleful clouds\nThey made to move on high.\n\n42. His the favor of Ull | and of all the gods\nWho first in the flames will reach;\nFor the house can be seen | by the sons of the gods\nIf the kettle aside were cast.\n\n43. In days of old | did Ivaldi's sons\nSkithblathnir fashion fair,\n\The best of ships | for the bright god Freyr,\nThe noble son of Njorth.\n\n[42. With this stanza Othin gets back to his immediate situation, bound as he is between two fires. He calls down a blessing on the man who will reach into the fire and pull aside the great kettle which, in Icelandic houses, hung directly under the smoke vent in the roof, and thus kept any one above from looking down into the interior. On ~<Ull~>, the archer-god, cf. stanza 5 and note. He is specified here apparently for no better reason than that his name fits the initial-rhyme.\n\n43. This and the following stanza are certainly interpolated, for they have nothing to do with the context, and stanza 45 continues the dramatic conclusion of the poem begun in stanza 42. This stanza is quoted by Snorri. ~<Ivaldi~> (\"The Mighty\"): he is known only as the father of the craftsmen-dwarfs who made not only the ship Skithblathnir, but also Othin's spear Gungnir, and the golden hair for Thor's wife, Sif, after Loki had maliciously cut her own hair off. ~<Skithblathnir~>: this ship (\"Wooden-Bladed\") always had a fair wind, whenever the sail was set; it could be folded up at will and put in the pocket. ~<Freyr~>: concerning him and his father, see Voluspo, 21, note, and ~<Skirnismol~>, introductory prose and note.]",
					
					"44. The best of trees | must Yggdrasil be,\nSkithblathnir best of boats;\nOf all the gods | is Othin the greatest,\nAnd Sleipnir the best of steeds;\nBifrost of bridges, | Bragi of skalds,\nHobrok of hawks, | and Garm of hounds.\n\n45. To the race of the gods | my face have I raised,\nAnd the wished-for aid have I waked;\nFor to all the gods | has the message gone\nThat sit in Ægir's seats,\nThat drink within Ægir's doors.\n\n[44. Snorri quotes this stanza. Like stanza 43 an almost certain interpolation, it was probably drawn in by the reference to Skithblathnir in the stanza interpolated earlier. It is presumably in faulty condition. One Ms. has after the fifth line half of a sixth,--\"Brimir of swords.\" ~<Yggdrasil~>: cf. stanzas 25-35. ~<Skithblathnir~>: cf. stanza 43, note. ~<Sleipnir~>: Othin's eight-legged horse, one of Loki's numerous progeny, borne by him to the stallion Svathilfari. This stallion belonged to the giant who built a fortress for the gods, and came so near to finishing it, with Svathilfari's aid, as to make the gods fear he would win his promised reward--Freyja and the sun and moon. To delay the work, Loki turned himself into a mare, whereupon the stallion ran away, and the giant failed to complete his task within the stipulated time. ~<Bilrost~>: probably another form of Bifrost (which Snorri has in his version of the stanza), on which cf. stanza 29. ~<Bragi~>: the god of poetry. He is one of the later figures among the gods, and is mentioned only three times in the poems of the ~<Edda~>. In Snorri's ~<Edda~>, however, he is of great importance. His wife is Ithun, goddess of youth. Perhaps the Norwegian skald Bragi Boddason, the oldest recorded skaldic poet, had been traditionally apotheosized as early as the tenth century. ~<Hobrok~>: nothing further is known of him. ~<Garm~>: cf. Voluspo, 44.\n\n45. With this stanza the narrative current of the poem is resumed. Ægir: the sea-god; cf. ~<Lokasenna~>, introductory prose.]",

Concerning the condition of stanzas 46-50, quoted by Snorri, nothing definite can be said. Lines and entire stanzas of this \"catalogue\" sort undoubtedly came and went with great freedom all through the period of oral transmission. Many of the names are not mentioned elsewhere, and often their significance is sheer guesswork. As in nearly every episode Othin appeared in disguise, the number of his names was necessarily almost limitless. ~<Grim~>: \"The Hooded.\" ~<Gangleri~>: \"The Wanderer.\" ~<Herjan~>: \"The Ruler.\" ~<Hjalmberi~>: \"The Helmet-Bearer.\" ~<Thekk~>: \"The Much-Loved.\" ~<Thrithi~>: \"The Third\" (in Snorri's Edda the stories are all told in the form of answers to questions, the speakers being Har, Jafnhar and Thrithi. Just what this tripartite form of Othin signifies has been the source of endless debate. Probably this line is late enough to betray the somewhat muddled influence of early Christianity.) ~<Thuth~> and ~<Uth~>: both names defy guesswork. ~<Helblindi~>: \"Hel-Blinder\" (two manuscripts have ~<Herblindi~>--\"Host-Blinder\"). ~<Hor~>: \"The High One.\"\n\n47. ~<Sath~>: \"The Truthful.\" ~<Svipal~>: \"The Changing.\" ~<Sanngetal~>: \"The Truth-Teller.\" ~<Herteit~>: \"Glad of the Host.\" ~<Hnikar~>: \"The Overthrower.\" ~<Bileyg~>: \"The Shifty-Eyed.\" ~<Baleyg~>: \"The Flaming-Eyed.\" ~<Bolverk~>: \"Doer of Ill\" (cf. Hovamol, 104 and note). ~<Fjolnir~>: \"The Many-Shaped.\" ~<Grimnir~>: \"The Hooded.\" ~<Glapswith~>: \"Swift in Deceit.\" ~<Fjolsvith~>: \"Wide of Wisdom.\"\n\n48. ~<Sithhott~>: \"With Broad Hat.\" ~<Sithskegg~>: \"Long-Bearded.\"]",

Nothing is known of Asmund, of Othin's appearance as Jalk, or of the occasion when he \"went in a sledge\" as Kjalar (\"Ruler of Keels\"?). ~<Thror~> and ~<Vithur~> are also of uncertain meaning. ~<Oski~>: \"God of Wishes.\" ~<Biflindi~>: the manuscripts vary widely in the form of this name. ~<Jafnhor~>: \"Equally High\" (cf. note on stanza 46). ~<Omi~>: \"The Shouter.\" ~<Gondlir~>: \"Wand Bearer.\" ~<Harbarth~>: \"Graybeard\" (cf. ~<Harbarthsljoth~>, introduction).\n\n50. Nothing further is known of the episode here mentioned Sokkmimir is presumably Mithvitnir's son. Snorri quotes the names Svithur and Svithrir, but omits all the remainder of the stanza.]",

					"King Geirröth sat and had his sword on his knee, half drawn from its sheath. But when he heard that Othin was come thither, then he rose up and sought to take Othin from the fire. The sword slipped from his hand, and fell with the hilt down. The king stumbled and fell forward, and the sword pierced him through, and slew him. Then Othin vanished, but Agnar long ruled there as king."

Snorri quotes the concluding stanza. In ~<Regius~> the poem is entitled \"For Scirnis\" (\"Skirnir's journey\").\n\nThe ~<Skirnismol~> differs sharply from the poems preceding it, in that it has a distinctly ballad quality. As a matter of fact, however, its verse is altogether dialogue, the narrative being supplied in the prose \"links,\" concerning which cf. introductory note to the ~<Grimnismol~>. The dramatic effectiveness and vivid characterization of the poem seem to connect it with the ~<Thrymskvitha~>, and the two may possibly have been put into their present form by the same man. Bugge's guess that the Skirnismol was the work of the author of the ~<Lokasenna~> is also possible, though it has less to support it.\n\nCritics have generally agreed in dating the poem as we now have it as early as the first half of the tenth century; Finnur Jonsson puts it as early as goo, and claims it, as usual, for Norway. Doubtless it was current in Norway, in one form or another, before the first Icelandic settlements, but his argument that the thistle (stanza 31) is not an Icelandic plant has little weight, for such curse-formulas must have traveled freely from place to place. In view of the evidence pointing to a western origin for many or all of the Eddic poems, Jonsson's reiterated \"Digtet er sikkert norsk og ikke islandsk\" is somewhat exasperating.

Freyr is the noblest of the gods; he rules over rain and sunshine, and therewith the fruitfulness of the earth; it is well to call upon him for plenty and welfare, for he rules over wealth for mankind. Freyja is the noblest of the goddesses. When she rides to the fight, she has one-half of the slain, and Othin has half. When she goes on a journey, she drives her two cats, and sits in a cart. Love-songs please her well, and it is good to call on her in love-matters.\" ~<Hlithskjolf~>: Othin's watch-tower; cf. ~<Grimnismol~>, introductory prose. ~<He~> ~<said~>: both manuscripts have \"Then Skathi said:\" (Skathi was Njorth's wife), but Bugge's emendation, based on Snorri's version, is doubtless correct.\n\n1. ~<My~> ~<son~>: both manuscripts, and many editors, have \"our son,\" which, of course, goes with the introduction of Skathi in the prose.

Three nouns of doubtful meaning, which I have rendered ~<rage~>, ~<longing~>, and ~<heart~> respectively, make the precise force of this stanza obscure. Niedner and Sijmons mark the entire stanza as interpolated, and Jonsson rejects line 5.\n\n30. In ~<Regius~> and in nearly all the editions the first two lines of this stanza are followed by lines 3-5 of stanza 35. I have followed Niedner, Sijmons, and Gering. The two words here translated ~<vile~> ~<things~> are obscure; Gering renders the phrase simply \"Kobolde.\"\n\n31. The confusion noted as to the preceding stanza, and a metrical error in the third line, have led to various rearrangements and emendations; line 3 certainly looks like an interpolation. ~<Three-headed~> ~<giants~>: concerning giants with numerous heads, cf. ~<Vafthruthnismol~>, 33, and ~<Hymiskvitha~>, 8.]",

No gap indicated in the manuscript; Niedner makes the line here given as 4 the first half of line 3, and fills out the stanza thus: \"with which I will tame you, / Maid, to work my will.\" The whole stanza seems to be either interpolated or out of place; it would fit better after stanza 25.\n\n33. Jonsson marks this stanza as interpolated. The word translated ~<most~> ~<evil~> is another case of guesswork.\n\n34. Most editors reject line 3 as spurious, and some also reject line 6. Lines 2 and 3 may have been expanded out of a single line running approximately \"Ye gods and Suttung's sons.\" ~<Suttung~>: concerning this giant cf. Hovamol, 104 and note.]",

The scribe clearly did not consider that the stanza began with line I, as the first word thereof in the manuscript does not begin with a capital letter and has no period before it. The first word of line 3, however, is so marked. Line 5 may well be spurious.\n\n37. Again the scribe seems to have been uncertain as to the stanza divisions. This time the first line is preceded by a period, but begins with a small letter. Many editors have made line 2]",

					"~<Harbarthsljoth~>\n\n~<The Poem of Harbarth~>\n\n~<Introductory Note~>\n\nThe Harbarthsljoth is found complete in the ~<Codex~> ~<Regius~>, where it follows the ~<Skirnismol~>, and from the fourth line of stan{z}a 19 to the end of the poem in the ~<Arnamagnæan~> ~<Codex~>, of which it occupies the first page and a half.\n\nThe poem differs sharply from those which precede it in the ~<Codex~> ~<Regius~>, both in metrical form and in spirit. It is, indeed, the most nearly formless of all the Eddic poems. The normal metre is the Malahattr (cf. Introduction, where an example is given). The name of this verse-form means \"in the manner of conversation,\" and the Harbarthsljoth's verse fully justifies the term. The Atli poems exemplify the conventional use of Malahattr, but in the Harbarthsljoth the form is used with extraordinary freedom, and other metrical forms are frequently employed. A few of the speeches of which the poem is composed cannot be twisted into any known Old Norse metre, and appear to be simply prose.\n\nHow far this confusion is due to interpolations and faulty transmission of the original poem is uncertain. Finnur Jonsson has attempted a wholesale purification of the poem, but his arbitrary condemnation of words, lines, and entire stanzas as spurious is quite unjustified by any positive evidence. I have accepted Mogk's theory that the author was \"a first-rate psychologist, but a poor poet,\" and have translated the poem as it stands in the manuscripts. I have preserved the metrical confusion of the original by keeping throughout so far as possible to the metres found in the poem; if the rhythm of the translation is often hard to catch, the difficulty is no less with the original Norse.\n\nThe poem is simply a contest of abuse, such as the early Norwegian and Icelander delighted in, the opposing figures being Thor and Othin, the latter appearing in the disguise of the ferryman Harbarth. Such billingsgate lent itself readily to changes, interpolations and omissions, and it is little wonder that the poem is chaotic. It consists mainly of boasting and of references, often luckily obscure, to disreputable events in the life of one or the other of the disputants. Some editors have sought to read a complex symbolism into it, particularly by representing",
					
					"it as a contest between the noble or warrior class (Othin) and the peasant (Thor). But it seems a pity to take such a vigorous piece of broad farce too seriously.\n\nVerse-form, substance, and certain linguistic peculiarities, notably the suffixed articles, point to a relatively late date (eleventh century) for the poem in its present form. Probably it had its origin in the early days, but its colloquial nature and its vulgarity made it readily susceptible to changes.\n\nOwing to the chaotic state of the text, and the fact that none of the editors or commentators have succeeded in improving it much, I have not in this case attempted to give all the important emendations and suggestions. The stanza-divisions are largely arbitrary.\n\n__________________\n\nThor was on his way back from a journey in the East, and came to a sound; on the other side of the sound was a ferryman with a boat. Thor called out:\n\n1. \"Who is the fellow yonder, | on the farther shore of the sound?\"\n\n[~<Prose~>. ~<Harbarth~> (\"Gray-Beard\"): Othin. On the nature of the prose notes found in the manuscripts, cf. ~<Grimnismol~>, introduction. ~<Thor~>: the journeys of the thunder-god were almost as numerous as those of Othin; cf. ~<Thrymskvitha~> and ~<Hymiskvitha~>. Like the Robin Hood of the British ballads, Thor was often temporarily worsted, but always managed to come out ahead in the end. His \"Journey in the East\" is presumably the famous episode, related in full by Snorri, in the course of which he en countered the giant Skrymir, and in the house of Utgartha-Loki lifted the cat which turned out to be Mithgarthsorm. The ~<Hymiskvitha~> relates a further incident of this journey.]",
					
					"~<The ferryman spake:~>\n2. \"What kind of a peasant is yon, | that calls o'er the bay?\"\n\n~<Thor spake:~>\n3. \"Ferry me over the sound; | I will feed thee therefor in the morning;\nA basket I have on my back, | and food therein, none better;\nAt leisure I ate, | ere the house I left,\nOf herrings and porridge, | so plenty I had.\"\n\n~<The ferryman spake:~>\n4. \"Of thy morning feats art thou proud, | but the future thou knowest not wholly;\nDoleful thine home-coming is: | thy mother, me thinks, is dead.\"\n\n~<Thor spake:~>\n5. \"Now hast thou said | what to each must seem\nThe mightiest grief, | that my mother is dead.\"\n\n[2. The superscriptions to the speeches are badly confused in the manuscripts, but editors have agreed fairly well as to where they belong. 3. From the fact that in ~<Regius~> line 3 begins with a capital letter, it is possible that lines 3-4 constitute the ferryman's reply, with something lost before stanza 4.\n\n4. ~<Thy~> ~<mother~>: Jorth (Earth).\n\n5.

After rescuing his father, Magni said to him: \"There would have been little trouble, father, had I but come sooner; I think I should have sent this giant to hell with my fist if I had met him first.\" Magni and his brother, Mothi, inherit Thor's hammer.\n\n12. This stanza is hopelessly confused as to form, but none of the editorial rearrangements have materially altered the meaning. ~<Doomed~> ~<to~> ~<die~>: the word \"feigr\" occurs constantly in the Old Norse poems and sagas; the idea of an inevitable but unknown fate seems to have been practically universal through out the pre-Christian period. On the concealment of names from enemies, cf. ~<Fafnismol~>, prose after stanza 1.]",

In the race, which Hrungnir lost, he managed to dash uninvited into the home of the gods, where he became very drunk. Thor ejected him, and accepted his challenge to a duel. Hrungnir, terrified, had a helper made for him in the form of a dummy giant nine miles high and three miles broad. Hrungnir himself had a three-horned heart of stone and a head of stone; his shield was of stone and his weapon was a grindstone. But Thjalfi, Thor's servant, told him the god would attack him out of the ground, wherefore Hrungnir laid down his shield and stood on it.

Thor is always eager for stories of this sort; cf. stanzas 31 and 33.\n\n19. Lines 1-2 are obscure, but apparently Harbarth means that the women were wise to give in to him cheerfully, resistance to his power being as impossible as (lines 3-4) making ropes of sand or digging the bottoms out of the valleys.

Loki, through whose fault she had been betrayed, was sent after her by the gods. He went in Freyja's \"hawk's-dress\" (cf. ~<Thrymskvitha~>, 3), turned Ithun into a nut, and flew back with her. Thjazi, in the shape of an eagle, gave chase. But the gods kindled a fire which burnt the eagle's wings, and then they killed him. Snorri's prose version does not attribute this feat particularly to Thor. Thjazi's daughter was Skathi, whom the gods permitted to marry Njorth as a recompense for her father's death. ~<Alvaldi~>: of him we know only that he was the father of Thjazi, Ithi and Gang, who divided his wealth, each taking a mouthful of gold.

Nowhere else is it indicated that Thor has an asylum for dead peasants.\n\n26. The reference here is to one of the most familiar episodes in Thor's eastward journey. He and his companions came to a house in the forest, and went in to spend the night. Being disturbed by an earthquake and a terrific noise, they all crawled into a smaller room opening from the main one. In the morning, however, they discovered that the earthquake had been occasioned by the giant Skrymir's lying down near them, and the noise by his snoring. The house in which they had taken refuge was his glove, the smaller room being the thumb. Skrymir was in fact Utgartha-Loki himself. That he is in this stanza called Fjalar (the name occurs also in ~<Hovamol~>, 14) is probably due to a confusion of the names by which Utgartha-Loki went. Loki taunts Thor with this adventure in ~<Lokasenna~>, 60 and 62, line 3 of this stanza being perhaps interpolated from ~<Lokasenna~>, 60, 4.]",

					"~<Hymiskvitha~>\n\n~<The Lay of Hymir~>\n\n~<Introductory Note~>\n\nThe ~<Hymiskvitha~> is found complete in both manuscripts; in ~<Regius~> it follows the ~<Harbarthsljoth~>, while in the ~<Arnamagnæan~> ~<Codex~> it comes after the ~<Grimnismol~>. Snorri does not quote it, although he tells the main story involved.\n\nThe poem is a distinctly inferior piece of work, obviously based on various narrative fragments, awkwardly pieced together. Some critics, Jessen and Edzardi for instance, have maintained that the compiler had before him three distinct poems, which he simply put together; others, like Finnur Jonsson and Mogk, think that the author made a new poem of his own on the basis of earlier poems, now lost. It seems probable that he took a lot of odds and ends of material concerning Thor, whether in prose or in verse, and worked them together in a perfunctory way, without much caring how well they fitted. His chief aim was probably to impress the credulous imaginations of hearers greedy for wonders.\n\nThe poem is almost certainly one of the latest of those dealing with the gods, though Finnur Jonsson, in order to support his theory of a Norwegian origin, has to date it relatively early. If, as seems probable, it was produced in Iceland, the chances are that it was composed in the first half of the eleventh century. Jessen, rather recklessly, goes so far as to put it two hundred years later. In any case, it belongs to a period of literary decadence,--the great days of Eddic poetry would never have permitted the nine hundred headed person found in Hymir's home-- and to one in which the usual forms of diction in mythological poetry had yielded somewhat to the verbal subtleties of skaldic verse.\n\nWhile the skaldic poetry properly falls outside the limits of this book, it is necessary here to say a word about it. There is preserved, in the sagas and elsewhere, a very considerable body of lyric poetry, the authorship of each poem being nearly always definitely stated, whether correctly or otherwise. This type of poetry is marked by an extraordinary complexity of diction, with a peculiarly difficult vocabulary of its own. It was to explain some of the \"kennings\" which composed this special",
					
					"vocabulary that Snorri wrote one of the sections of the ~<Prose~> ~<Edda~>. As an illustration, in a single stanza of one poem in the ~<Egilssaga~>, a sword is called \"the halo of the helm,\" \"the wound-hoe,\" \"the blood-snake\" (possibly; no one is sure what the compound word means) and \"the ice of the girdle,\" while men appear in the same stanza as \"Othin's ash-trees,\" and battle is spoken of as \"the iron game.\" One of the eight lines has defied translation completely.\n\nSkaldic diction made relatively few inroads into the earlier Eddic poems, but in the ~<Hymiskvitha~> these circumlocutions are fairly numerous. This sets the poem somewhat apart from the rest of the mythological collection. Only the vigor of the two main stories--Thor's expedition after Hymir's kettle and the fishing trip in which he caught Mithgarthsorm--saves it from complete mediocrity.\n\n1. Of old the gods | made feast together,\nAnd drink they sought | ere sated they were;\nTwigs they shook, | and blood they tried:\nRich fare in Ægir's | hall they found.\n\n[1. ~<Twigs~>: Vigfusson comments at some length on \"the rite practised in the heathen age of inquiring into the future by dipping bunches of chips or twigs into the blood (of sacrifices) and shaking them.\" But the two operations may have been separate, the twigs being simply \"divining-rods\" marked with runes. In either case, the gods were seeking information by magic as to where they could find plenty to drink. ~<Ægir~>: a giant who is also the god of the sea; little is known of him outside of what is told here and in the introductory prose to the ~<Lokasenna~>, though Snorri has a brief account of him, giving his home as Hlesey (Läsö, cf. ~<Harbarthsljoth~>, 37). ~<Grimnismol~>, 45, has a reference to this same feast.]",
					
					"2. The mountain-dweller | sat merry as boyhood,\nBut soon like a blinded | man he seemed;\nThe son of Ygg | gazed in his eyes:\n\"For the gods a feast | shalt thou forthwith get.\"\n\n3. The word-wielder toil | for the giant worked,\nAnd so revenge | on the gods he sought;\nHe bade Sif's mate | the kettle bring:\n\"Therein for ye all | much ale shall I brew.\"\n\n4. The far-famed ones | could find it not,\nAnd the holy gods | could get it nowhere;\nTill in truthful wise | did Tyr speak forth,\nAnd helpful counsel | to Hlorrithi gave.\n\n5. \"There dwells to the east | of Elivagar\nHymir the wise | at the end of heaven;\nA kettle my father | fierce doth own,\nA mighty vessel | a mile in depth.\"\n\n[2. ~<Mountain-dweller~>: the giant (Ægir). ~<Line 2~>: the principal word in the original has defied interpretation, and any translation of the line must be largely guesswork. ~<Ygg~>: Othin; his son is Thor. Some editors assume a gap after this stanza.\n\n3. ~<Word-wielder~>: Thor. ~<The giant~>: Ægir. ~<Sif~>: Thor's wife; cf. Harbarthsljoth, 48. ~<The~> ~<kettle~>: Ægir's kettle is possibly the sea itself.\n\n4. ~<Tyr~>: the god of battle; his two great achievements were thrusting his hand into the mouth of the wolf Fenrir so that the gods might bind him, whereby he lost his hand (cf. ~<Voluspo~>, 39, note), and his fight with the hound Garm in the last battle, in which they kill each other. ~<Hlorrithi~>: Thor.\n\n5. ~<Elivagar~> (\"Stormy Waves\"): possibly the Milky Way;]",

The youth found his grandam, | that greatly he loathed,\n\n[cf. ~<Vafthruthnismol~>, 31, note. ~<Hymir~>: this giant figures only in this episode. It is not clear why Tyr, who is elsewhere spoken of as a son of Othin, should here call Hymir his father. Finnur Jonsson, in an attempt to get round this difficulty, deliberately changed the word \"father\" to \"grandfather,\" but this does not help greatly.\n\n6. Neither manuscript has any superscriptions, but most editors have supplied them as above. From this point through stanza it the editors have varied considerably in grouping the lines into stanzas. The manuscripts indicate the third lines of stanzas 7, 8, 9, and to as beginning stanzas, but this makes more complications than the present arrangement. It is possible that, as Sijmons suggests, two lines have been lost after stanza 6.\n\n7. ~<Egil~>: possibly, though by no means certainly, the father of Thor's servant, Thjalfi, for, according to Snorri, Thor's first stop on this journey was at the house of a peasant whose children, Thjalfi and Roskva, he took into his service; cf. stanza 38, note. The ~<Arnamagnæan~> ~<Codex~> has \"Ægir\" instead of \"Egil,\" but, aside from the fact that Thor had just left Ægir's house, the sea-god can hardly have been spoken of as a goat-herd.\n\n8. ~<The~> ~<youth~>: Tyr, whose extraordinary grandmother is Hymir's mother. We know nothing further of her, or of the other,]",
					
					"And full nine hundred | heads she had;\nBut the other fair | with gold came forth,\nAnd the bright-browed one | brought beer to her son.\n\n9. \"Kinsman of giants, | beneath the kettle\nWill I set ye both, | ye heroes bold;\nFor many a time | my dear-loved mate\nTo guests is wrathful | and grim of mind.\"\n\n10. Late to his home | the misshapen Hymir,\nThe giant harsh, | from his hunting came;\nThe icicles rattled | as in he came,\nFor the fellow's chin-forest | frozen was.\n\n11. \"Hail to thee, Hymir! | good thoughts mayst thou have;\nHere has thy son | to thine hall now come;\n(For him have we waited, | his way was long;)\nAnd with him fares | the foeman of Hroth,\nThe friend of mankind, | and Veur they call him.\n\n[who is Hymir's wife and Tyr's mother. It may be guessed, however, that she belonged rather to the race of the gods than to that of the giants.\n\n11. Two or three editors give this stanza a superscription (\"The concubine spake\", \"The daughter spake\"). Line 3 is commonly regarded as spurious. ~<The~> ~<foeman~> ~<of~> ~<Hroth~>: of course this means Thor, but nothing is known of any enemy of his by this name. Several editors have sought to make a single word meaning \"the famous enemy\" out of the phrase. Concerning Thor as the friend of man, particularly of the peasant class, cf. introduction to Harbarthsljoth. ~<Veur~>: another name, of uncertain meaning, for Thor.]",

Hymir's wrath does not permit him to ignore the duties of a host to his guests, always strongly insisted on.\n\n15. Thor's appetite figures elsewhere; cf. ~<Thrymskvitha~>, 24.\n\n16. ~<The~> ~<comrade~> ~<of~> ~<Hrungnir~>: Hymir, presumably simply because both are giants; cf. ~<Harbarthsljoth~>, 14 and note.]",

Sijmons and Gering assume a gap after these two lines, but it seems more probable that the missing passage, if any, belonged before them, supplying the connection with the previous stanza.\n\n18. The manuscripts have no superscription. Many editors combine lines 3 and 4 with lines 1 and 2 of stanza 19. In Snorri's extended paraphrase of the story, Hymir declines to go fishing with Thor on the ground that the latter is too small a person to be worth bothering about. \"You would freeze,\" he says, \"if you stayed out in mid-ocean as long as I generally do.\" ~<Bait~> (line 4): the word literally means \"chaff,\" hence any small bits; Hymir means that Thor should collect dung for bait.\n\n19. Many editors combine lines 3 and 4 with stanza 20. ~<Fortress~>, etc.: the ox's head; cf. introductory note concerning the diction of this poem. Several editors assume a lacuna after stanza 19, but this seems unnecessary.]",

The lacuna after stanza 20 is assumed by most editors.\n\n21. ~<Lord~> ~<of~> ~<the~> ~<goats~>: Thor, because of his goat-drawn chariot. ~<Ape-begotten~>: Hymir; the word \"api,\" rare until relatively late times in its literal sense, is fairly common with the meaning of \"fool.\" Giants were generally assumed to be stupid. ~<Steed~> ~<of~> ~<the~> ~<rollers~>: a ship, because boats were pulled up on shore by means of rollers.\n\n23. ~<Warder~> ~<of~> ~<men~>: Thor; cf. stanza 11. ~<Worm's~> ~<destroyer~>: likewise Thor, who in the last battle slays, and is slain by, Mithgarthsorm; cf. ~<Voluspo~>, 56. ~<The~> ~<foe~> ~<of~> ~<the~> ~<gods~>: Mithgarthsorm, who lies in the sea, and surrounds the whole earth.]",

No gap is indicated in the manuscripts, but that a line or more has been lost is highly probable. In Snorri's version, Thor pulls so hard on the line that he drives both his feet through the flooring of the boat, and stands on bottom. When he pulls the serpent up, Hymir cuts the line with his bait-knife, which explains the serpent's escape. Thor, in a rage, knocks Hymir overboard with his hammer, and then wades ashore. The lines of stanzas 25 and 26 have been variously grouped.\n\n26.

					"~<Lokasenna~>\n\n~<Loki's Wrangling~>\n\n~<Introductory Notes~>\n\nThe ~<Lokasenna~> is found only in ~<Regius~>, where it follows the ~<Hymiskvitha~>; Snorri quotes four lines of it, grouped together as a single stanza.\n\nThe poem is one of the most vigorous of the entire collection, and seems to have been preserved in exceptionally good condition. The exchange or contest of insults was dear to the Norse heart, and the ~<Lokasenna~> consists chiefly of Loki's taunt; to the assembled gods and goddesses, and their largely ineffectual attempts to talk back to him. The author was evidently well versed in mythological fore, and the poem is full of references to incidents not elsewhere recorded. As to its date and origin there is the usual dispute, but the latter part of the tenth century and Iceland seem the best guesses.\n\nThe prose notes are long and of unusual interest. The introductory one links the poem closely to the ~<Hymiskvitha~>, much as the ~<Reginsmol~>, ~<Fafnismol~> and ~<Sigrdrifumol~> are linked together; the others fill in the narrative gaps in the dialogue--very like stage directions,--and provide a conclusion by relating Loki's punishment, which, presumably, is here connected with the wrong incident. It is likely that often when the poem was recited during the two centuries or so before it was committed to writing, the speaker inserted some such explanatory comments, and the compiler of the collection followed this example by adding such explanations as he thought necessary. The ~<Lokasenna~> is certainly much older than the ~<Hymiskvitha~>, the connection between them being purely one of subject-matter; and the twelfth-century compiler evidently knew a good deal less about mythology than the author whose work he was annotating.\n\n__________________\n\nÆgir, who was also called Gymir, had prepared ale for the gods, after he had got the mighty kettle, as now has been told. To this feast came Othin and Frigg, his wife. Thor came not, as he was on a journey in the East. Sif,",
					
					"Thor's wife, was there, and Brag, with Ithun, his wife. Tyr, who had but one hand, was there; the wolf Fenrir had bitten off his other hand when they had bound him. There were Njorth and Skathi his wife, Freyr and Freyja, and Vithar, the son of Othin. Loki was there, and Freyr's\n\n[~<Prose~>. ~<Ægir~>: the sea-god; Snorri gives Hler as another of his names, but he is not elsewhere called Gymir, which is the name of the giant, Gerth's father, in the Skirnismol. On Ægir cf. ~<Grimnismol~>, 45, and ~<Hymiskvitha~>, 1. ~<Frigg~>: though Othin's wife is often mentioned, she plays only a minor part in the Eddic poems; cf. ~<Voluspo~>, 34, ~<Vafthruthnismol~>, I, and ~<Grimnismol~>, introductory prose. ~<Thor~>: the compiler is apparently a trifle confused as to Thor's movements; the \"Journey in the East\" here mentioned cannot be the one described in the ~<Hymiskvitha~>, nor yet the one narrated by Snorri, as Loki was with Thor through out that expedition. He probably means no more than that Thor was off killing giants. ~<Sif~>: concerning Thor's wife the chief incident is that Loki cut off her hair, and, at the command of the wrathful Thor, was compelled to have the dwarfs fashion her a new supply of hair out of gold; cf. ~<Harbarthsljoth~>, 48. ~<Bragi~>: the god of poetry; cf. ~<Grimnismol~>, 44 and note. ~<Ithun~>: the goddess of youth; cf. note on ~<Skirnismol~>, 19. Ithun is not mentioned by name in any other of the Eddic poems, but Snorri tells in detail how the giant Thjazi stole her and her apples, explaining the reference in ~<Harbarthsljoth~>, 19 (q. v.). ~<Tyr~>: the god of battle; cf. ~<Hymiskvitha~>, 4, and (concerning his dealings with the wolf Fenrir) ~<Voluspo~>, 39, note. ~<Njorth~>: the chief of the Wanes, and father of Freyr and Freyja; cf. (concerning the whole family) ~<Skirnismol~>, introductory prose and note, also ~<Voluspo~>, 21 and note. ~<Skathi~>: Njorth's wife was the daughter of the giant Thjazi; cf. ~<Harbarthsljoth~>, 19, note, and ~<Grimnismol~>, 17. ~<Vithar~>: the silent god, the son of Othin who avenged his father by slaying the wolf Fenrir; cf. ~<Voluspo~>, 54, ~<Vafthruthnismol~>, 51, and ~<Grimnismol~>, 17. ~<Loki~>: the mischief-making fire-god; in addition to the many references to his career in the Lokasenna, cf. particularly ~<Voluspo~>, 32 and 35, and notes. ~<Byggvir~> ~<and~> ~<Beyla~>: not mentioned elsewhere in the poems; Freyr's conspicuous servant is Skirnir, hero of the Skirnismol. ~<Fimafeng~> (\"The Swift Handler\")]",

Glittering gold they had in place of firelight; the ale came in of itself; and great was the peace. The guests praised much the ability of Ægir's serving-men. Loki might not endure that, and he slew Fimafeng. Then the gods shook their shields and howled at Loki and drove him away to the forest, and thereafter set to drinking again. Loki turned back, and outside he met Eldir. Loki spoke to him:\n\n1. \"Speak now, Eldir, | for not one step\nFarther shalt thou fare;\nWhat ale-talk here | do they have within,\nThe sons of the glorious gods?\"\n\n~<Eldir spake:~>\n2. \"Of their weapons they talk, | and their might in war,\nThe sons of the glorious gods;\nFrom the gods and elves | who are gathered here\nNo friend in words shalt thou find.\"\n\n~<Loki spake:~>\n3. \"In shall I go | into Ægir's hall,\nFor the feast I fain would see;\n\n[and ~<Eldir~> (\"The Man of the Fire\"): mentioned only in connection with this incident. ~<Glittering~> ~<gold~>: Ægir's use of gold to light his hall, which was often thought of as under the sea, was responsible for the phrase \"flame of the flood,\" and sundry kindred phrases, meaning \"gold.\"]",

Why Loki taunts him with cowardice (stanzas 11-13-15) is not clear, for poetry, of which Bragi was the patron, was generally associated in the Norse mind with peculiar valor, and most of the skaldic poets were likewise noted fighters.\n\n9. There exists no account of any incident in which Othin and Loki thus swore blood-brotherhood, but they were so often allied in enterprises that the idea is wholly reasonable. The common process of \"mingling blood\" was carried out quite literally, and the promise of -which Loki speaks is characteristic of those which, in the sagas, often accompanied the ceremony; cf. Brot af Sigurtharkvithu, 18 and note.\n\n10. In stanzas 10-31 the manuscript has nothing to indicate the identity of the several speakers, but these are uniformly clear]",

The goddesses who, finding that their husbands are getting the worst of it, take up the cudgels with Loki, all find themselves confronted with undeniable facts in their own careers; cf. stanzas 26 (Frigg), 52 (Skathi) and 54 (Sif). Gefjun and Freyja are silenced in similar fashion. ~<Wish-son~>: adopted son; Loki was the son of the giant Farbauti and the giantess Laufey, and hence was not of the race of the gods, but had been virtually adopted by Othin, who subsequently had good reason to regret it.]",

As for the necklace (line 3), it may be the Brisings' necklace, which appears in the ~<Thrymskvitha~> as Freyja's, but which, in some mythological writings, is assigned to Frigg.\n\n21.

A giant had undertaken to build the gods a fortress, his reward being Freyja and the sun and moon, provided the work was done by a given time. His sole helper was his horse, Svathilfari.

Snorri does not quote from it, nor, rather oddly, does the story occur in the ~<Prose~> ~<Edda~>.\n\nArtistically the ~<Thrymskvitha~> is one of the best, as it is, next to the ~<Voluspo~>, the most famous, of the entire collection. It has, indeed, been called \"the finest ballad in the world,\" and not without some reason. Its swift, vigorous action, the sharpness of its characterization and the humor of the central situation combine to make it one of the most vivid short narrative poems ever composed. Of course we know nothing specific of its author, but there can be no question that he was a poet of extraordinary ability. The poem assumed its present form, most critics agree, somewhere about 900, and thus it is one of the oldest in the collection. It has been suggested, on the basis of stylistic similarity, that its author may also have composed the ~<Skirnismol~>, and possibly ~<Baldrs~> ~<Draumar~>. There is also some resemblance between the ~<Thrymskvitha~> and the ~<Lokasenna~> (note, in this connection, Bugge's suggestion that the ~<Skirnismol~> and the ~<Lokasenna~> may have been by the same man), and it is not impossible that all four poems have a single authorship.\n\nThe ~<Thrymskvitha~> has been preserved in excellent condition, without any serious gaps or interpolations.

					"~<Alvissmol~>\n\n~<The Ballad of Alvis~>\n\n~<Introductory Note~>\n\nNo better summary of the Alvissmol can be given than Gering's statement that \"it is a versified chapter from the skaldic Poetics.\" The narrative skeleton, contained solely in stanzas 1-8 and in 35, is of the slightest; the dwarf Alvis, desirous of marrying Thor's daughter, is compelled by the god to answer a number of questions to test his knowledge. That all his answers are quite satisfactory makes no difference whatever to the outcome. The questions and answers differ radically from those of the ~<Vafthruthnismol~>. Instead of being essentially mythological, they all concern synonyms. Thor asks what the earth, the sky, the moon, and so on, are called \"in each of all the worlds,\" but there is no apparent significance in the fact that the gods call the earth one thing and the giants call it another; the answers are simply strings of poetic circumlocutions, or \"kennings.\" Concerning the use of these \"kennings\" in skaldic poetry, cf. introductory note to the ~<Hymiskvitha~>.\n\nMogk is presumably right in dating the poem as late as the twelfth century, assigning it to the period of \"the Icelandic renaissance of skaldic poetry.\" It appears to have been the work of a man skilled in poetic construction,--Thor's questions, for instance, are neatly balanced in pairs,--and fully familiar with the intricacies of skaldic diction, but distinctly weak in his mythology. In other words, it is learned rather than spontaneous poetry. Finnur Jonsson's attempt to make it a tenth century Norwegian poem baffles logic. Vigfusson is pretty sure the poem shows marked traces of Celtic influence, which is by no means incompatible with Mogk's theory (cf. introductory note to the ~<Rigsthula~>).\n\nThe poem is found only in ~<Regius~>, where it follows the Thrymskvitha. Snorri quotes stanzas 2c, and 30, the manuscripts of the ~<Prose Edda~> giving the name of the poem as ~<Alvissmol~>, ~<Alsvinnsmol~> or ~<Olvismol~>. It is apparently in excellent condition, without serious errors of transmission, although interpolations or omissions in such a poem might have been made so easily as to defy detection.\n\nThe translation of the many synonyms presents, of course,",

Her mother was Sif, Thor's wife, whereas the god's sons were born of a giantess. ~<Benches~>: cf. ~<Lokasenna~>, 15 and note.\n\n2.

It is preserved in various late paper manuscripts, with the title ~<Vegtamskvitha~> (The Lay of Vegtam), which has been used by some editors.\n\nThe poem, which contains but fourteen stanzas, has apparently been preserved in excellent condition. Its subject-matter and style link it closely with the Voluspo. Four of the five lines of stanza 11 appear, almost without change, in the ~<Voluspo~>, 32-33, and the entire poem is simply an elaboration of the episode outlined in those and the preceding stanzas. It has been suggested that ~<Baldrs~> ~<Draumar~> and the Voluspo may have been by the same author. There is also enough similarity in style between ~<Baldrs~> ~<Draumar~> and the ~<Thrymskvitha~> (note especially the opening stanza) to give color to Vigfusson's guess that these two poems had a common authorship. In any case, ~<Baldrs~> ~<Draumar~> presumably assumed its present form not later than the first half of the tenth century.\n\nWhether the Volva (wise-woman) of the poem is identical with the speaker in the ~<Voluspo~> is purely a matter for conjecture. Nothing definitely opposes such a supposition. As in the longer poem she foretells the fall of the gods, so in this case she prophesies the first incident of that fall, the death of Baldr. Here she is called up from the dead by Othin, anxious to know the meaning of Baldr's evil dreams; in the ~<Voluspo~> it is likewise intimated that the Volva has risen from the grave.\n\nThe poem, like most of the others in the collection, is essentially dramatic rather than narrative, summarizing a story which was doubtless familiar to every one who heard the poem recited.\n__________________\n\n1.

				Text = {
					"~<Rigsthula~>\n\n~<The Song of Rig~>\n\n~<Introductory Note~>\n\nThe ~<Rigsthula~> is found in neither of the principal codices. The only manuscript containing it is the so-called ~<Codex~> ~<Wormanius~>, a manuscript of Snorri's ~<Prose~> ~<Edda~>. The poem appears on the last sheet of this manuscript, which unluckily is incomplete, and thus the end of the poem is lacking. In the ~<Codex~> ~<Wormanius~> itself the poem has no title, but a fragmentary parchment included with it calls the poem the ~<Rigsthula~>. Some late paper manuscripts give it the title of ~<Rigsmol~>.\n\nThe ~<Rigsthula~> is essentially unlike anything else which editors have agreed to include in the so-called ~<Edda~>. It is a definitely cultural poem, explaining, on a mythological basis, the origin of the different castes of early society: the thralls, the peasants, and the warriors. From the warriors, finally, springs one who is destined to become a king, and thus the whole poem is a song in praise of the royal estate. This fact in itself would suffice to indicate that the ~<Rigsthula~> was not composed in Iceland, where for centuries kings were regarded with profound disapproval.\n\nNot only does the ~<Rigsthula~> praise royalty, but it has many of the earmarks of a poem composed in praise of a particular king. The manuscript breaks off at a most exasperating point, just as the connection between the mythical \"Young Kon\" (Konr ungr, konungr, \"king\"; but cf. stanza 44, note) and the monarch in question is about to be established. Owing to the character of the Norse settlements in Iceland, Ireland, and the western islands generally, search for a specific king leads back to either Norway or Denmark; despite the arguments advanced by Edzardi, Vigfusson, Powell, and others, it seems most improbable that such a poem should have been produced elsewhere than on the Continent, the region where Scandinavian royalty most flourished. Finnur Jonsson's claim for Norway, with Harald the Fair-Haired as the probable king in question, is much less impressive than Mogk's ingenious demonstration that the poem was in all probability composed in Denmark, in honor of either Gorm the Old or Harald Blue-Tooth. His proof is based chiefly on the evidence provided by stanza 49, and is summarized in the note to that stanza.",
					
					"The poet, however, was certainly not a Dane, but probably a wandering Norse singer, who may have had a dozen homes, and who clearly had spent much time in some part of the western island world chiefly inhabited by Celts. The extent of Celtic influence on the Eddic poems in general is a matter of sharp dispute. Powell, for example, claims almost all the poems for the \"Western Isles,\" and attributes nearly all their good qualities to Celtic influence. Without here attempting to enter into the details of the argument, it may be said that the weight of authoritative opinion, while clearly recognizing the marks of Celtic influence in the poems, is against this view; contact between the roving Norsemen of Norway and Iceland and the Celts of Ireland and the \"Western Isles,\" and particularly the Orkneys, was so extensive as to make the presumption of an actual Celtic home for the poems seem quite unnecessary.\n\nIn the case of the ~<Rigsthula~> the poet unquestionably had not only picked up bits of the Celtic speech (the name Rig itself is almost certainly of Celtic origin, and there are various other Celtic words employed), but also had caught something of the Celtic literary spirit. This explains the cultural nature of the poem, quite foreign to Norse poetry in general. On the other hand, the style as a whole is vigorously Norse, and thus the explanation that the poem was composed by an itinerant Norse poet who had lived for some time in the Celtic islands, and who was on a visit to the court of a Danish king, fits the ascertainable facts exceedingly well. As Christianity was introduced into Denmark around 960, the ~<Rigsthula~> is not likely to have been composed much after that date, and probably belongs to the first half of the tenth century. Gorm the Old died about the year 935, and was succeeded by Harald Blue-Tooth, who died about 985.\n\nThe fourteenth (or late thirteenth) century annotator identifies Rig with Heimdall, but there is nothing in the poem itself, and very little anywhere else, to warrant this, and it seems likely that the poet had Othin, and not Heimdall, in mind, his purpose being to trace the origin of the royal estate to the chief of the gods. The evidence bearing on this identification is briefly summed up in the note on the introductory prose passage, but the question involves complex and baffling problems in mythology, and from very early times the status of Heimdall was unquestionably confusing to the Norse mind.",
					
					"They tell in old stories that one of the gods, whose name was Heimdall, went on his way along a certain seashore, and came to a dwelling, where he called himself Rig. According to these stories is the following poem:\n\n1. Men say there went | by ways so green\nOf old the god, | the aged and wise,\nMighty and strong | did Rig go striding.\n. . . . . . . . . .\n\n[~<Prose~>. It would be interesting to know how much the annotator meant by the phrase ~<old~> ~<stories~>. Was he familiar with the tradition in forms other than that of the poem? If so, his introductory note was scanty, for, outside of identifying ~<Rig~> as ~<Heimdall~>, he provides no information not found in the poem. Probably he meant simply to refer to the poem itself as a relic of antiquity, and the identification of Rig as Heimdall may well have been an attempt at constructive criticism of his own. The note was presumably written somewhere about 1300, or even later, and there is no reason for crediting the annotator with any considerable knowledge of mythology. There is little to favor the identification of Rig with Heimdall, the watchman of the gods, beyond a few rather vague passages in the other poems. Thus in ~<Voluspo~>, I, the Volva asks hearing \"from Heimdall's sons both high and low\"; in ~<Grimnismol~>, 13, there is a very doubtful line which may mean that Heimdall \"o'er men holds sway, it is said,\" and in \"the Short Voluspo\" (~<Hyndluljoth~>, 40) he is called \"the kinsman of men.\" On the other hand, everything in the ~<Rigsthula~>, including the phrase \"the aged and wise\" in stanza I, and the references to runes in stanzas 36, 44, and 46, fits Othin exceedingly well. It seems probable that the annotator was wrong, and that Rig is Othin, and not Heimdall. ~<Rig~>: almost certainly based on the Old Irish word for \"king,\" \"ri\" or \"rig.\"\n\n1. No gap is indicated, but editors have generally assumed one. Some editors, however, add line 1 of stanza 2 to stanza 1.]",

After line 1 the manuscript has only four words: \"cloth,\" \"black,\" \"named,\" and \"Thræll.\" No gap is anywhere indicated.

He married the daughter of a certain Danp, lord of Danpsted, whose name was Dana; and later, having won the royal title for his province, left as his heir his son by Dana, called Dan or Danum, all of whose subjects were called Danes.\" This may or may not be conclusive, and it is a great pity that the manuscript breaks off abruptly at this stanza.]"

					"~<Hyndluljoth~>\n\n~<The Poem of Hyndla~>\n\n~<Introductory Note~>\n\nThe Hyndluljoth is found in neither of the great manuscripts of the Poetic Edda, but is included in the so-called ~<Flateyjarbok~> (Book of the Flat Island), an enormous compilation made some where about 1400. The lateness of this manuscript would of itself be enough to cast a doubt upon the condition in which the poem has been preserved, and there can be no question that what we have of it is in very poor shape. It is, in fact, two separate poems, or parts of them, clumsily put together. The longer one, the ~<Poem~> ~<of~> ~<Hyndla~> proper, is chiefly a collection of names, not strictly mythological but belonging to the semi-historical hero-sagas of Norse tradition. The wise-woman, Hyndla, being asked by Freyja to trace the ancestry of her favorite, Ottar, for the purpose of deciding a wager, gives a complex genealogy including many of the heroes who appear in the popular sagas handed down from days long before the Icelandic settlements. The poet was learned, but without enthusiasm; it is not likely that he composed the ~<Hyndluljoth~> much before the twelfth century, though the material of which it is compounded must have been very much older. Although the genealogies are essentially continental, the poem seems rather like a product of the archæological period of Iceland.\n\nInserted bodily in the ~<Hyndluljoth~> proper is a fragment of fifty-one lines, taken from a poem of which, by a curious chance, we know the name. Snorri quotes one stanza of it, calling it \"the short ~<Voluspo~>.\" The fragment preserved gives, of course, no indication of the length of the original poem, but it shows that it was a late and very inferior imitation of the great ~<Voluspo~>. Like the Hyndluljoth proper, it apparently comes from the twelfth century; but there is nothing whatever to indicate that the two poems were the work of the same man, or were ever connected in any way until some blundering copyist mixed them up. Certainly the connection did not exist in the middle of the thirteenth century, when Snorri quoted \"the short ~<Voluspo~>.\"\n\nNeither poem is of any great value, either as mythology or as poetry. The author of \"the short ~<Voluspo~>\" seems, indeed, to have been more or less confused as to his facts; and both poets were",
					
					"too late to feel anything of the enthusiasm of the earlier school. The names of Hyndla's heroes, of course, suggest an unlimited number of stories, but as most of these have no direct relation to the poems of the ~<Edda~>, I have limited the notes to a mere record of who the persons mentioned were, and the saga-groups in which they appeared.\n\n~<Freyja spake:~>\n1. \"Maiden, awake! | wake thee, my friend,\nMy sister Hyndla, | in thy hollow cave!\nAlready comes darkness, | and ride must we\nTo Valhall to seek | the sacred hall.\n\n2. \"The favor of Heerfather | seek we to find,\nTo his followers gold | he gladly gives;\nTo Hermoth gave he | helm and mail-coat,\nAnd to Sigmund he gave | a sword as gift.\n\n[1. Freyja: The names of the speakers do not appear in the manuscripts. On Freyja cf. ~<Voluspo~>, 21 and note; ~<Skirnismol~>, introductory prose and note; ~<Lokasenna~>, introductory prose and note. As stanzas 9-10 show, Ottar has made a wager of his entire inheritance with Angantyr regarding the relative loftiness of their ancestry, and by rich offerings (Hyndla hints at less commendable methods) has induced Freyja to assist him in establishing his genealogy. Freyja, having turned Ottar for purposes of disguise into a boar, calls on the giantess Hyndla (\"She-Dog\") to aid her. Hyndla does not appear elsewhere in the poems.\n\n2. ~<Heerfather~>: Othin; cf. ~<Voluspo~>, 30. Hermoth: mentioned in the ~<Prose~> ~<Edda~> as a son of Othin who is sent to Hel to ask for the return of the slain Baldr. ~<Sigmund~>: according to the ~<Volsungasaga~> Sigmund was the son of Volsung, and hence Othin's great-great-grandson (note that Wagner eliminates all the intervening generations by the simple expedient of using]",

Sigmund alone was able to draw from the tree the sword which a mysterious stranger (Othin, of course) had thrust into it (compare the first act of Wagner's ~<Die~> ~<Walküre~>).\n\n3. Sijmons suggests that this stanza may be an interpolation.\n\n4. No lacuna after line 2 is indicated in the manuscript. Editors have attempted various experiments in rearranging this and the following stanza.\n\n5. Some editors, following Simrock, assign this whole stanza to Hyndla; others assign to her lines 3-4. Giving the entire stanza to Freyja makes better sense than any other arrangement, but is dependent on changing the manuscript's \"thy\" in line 3 to \"my\", as suggested by Bugge. The boar on which Freyja rides (\"my worthy steed\") is, of course, Ottar.\n\n6. Hyndla detects Ottar, and accuses Freyja of having her]",

Various experiments have been made in condensing the stanza into four lines, or in combining it with stanza 8. ~<Hildisvini~> (\"Battle-Swine\"): perhaps Freyja refers to the boar with golden bristles given, according to Snorri, to her brother Freyr by the dwarfs. ~<Dain~>: a dwarf; cf. ~<Voluspo~>, 11. ~<Nabbi~>: a dwarf nowhere else mentioned.\n\n8. The first line is obviously corrupt in the manuscript, and has been variously emended. The general assumption is that in the interval between stanzas 7 and 8 Freyja and Hyndla have arrived at Valhall. No lacuna is indicated in the manuscript.\n\n9. ~<Foreign~> ~<metal~>: gold.

					"~<Svipdagsmol~>\n\n~<The Ballad of Svipdag~>\n\n~<Introductory Note~>\n\nThe two poems, ~<Grougaldr~> (~<Groa's~> ~<Spell~>) and ~<Fjolsvinnsmol~> (the ~<Ballad~> ~<of~> ~<Fjolsvith~>), which many editors have, very wisely, united under the single title of Svipdagsmol, are found only in paper manuscripts, none of them antedating the seventeenth century. Everything points to a relatively late origin for the poems: their extensive use of \"kennings\" or poetical circumlocutions, their romantic spirit, quite foreign to the character of the unquestionably older poems, the absence of any reference to them in the earlier documents, the frequent errors in mythology, and, finally, the fact that the poems appear to have been preserved in unusually good condition. Whether or not a connecting link of narrative verse joining the two parts has been lost is an open question; on the whole it seems likely that the story was sufficiently well known so that the reciter of the poem (or poems) merely filled in the gap with a brief prose summary in pretty much his own words. The general relationship between dialogue and narrative in the Eddic poems is discussed in the introductory note to the ~<Grimnismol~>, in connection with the use of prose links.\n\nThe love story of Svipdag and Mengloth is not referred to elsewhere in the ~<Poetic~> ~<Edda~>, nor does Snorri mention it; however, Groa, who here appears as Svipdag's mother, is spoken of by Snorri as a wise woman, the wife of Orvandil, who helps Thor with her magic charms. On the other hand, the essence of the story, the hero's winning of a bride ringed about by flames, is strongly suggestive of parts of the Sigurth-Brynhild traditions. Whether or not it is to be regarded as a nature or solar myth depends entirely on one's view of the whole \"solar myth\" school of criticism, not so highly esteemed today as formerly; such an interpretation is certainly not necessary to explain what is, under any circumstances, a very charming romance told, in the main, with dramatic effectiveness.\n\nIn later years the story of Svipdag and Mengloth became popular throughout the North, and was made the subject of many Danish and Swedish as well as Norwegian ballads. These have greatly assisted in the reconstruction of the outlines of the narrative surrounding the dialogue poems here given.",

					"~<Völundarkvitha~>\n\n~<The Lay of Völund~>\n\n~<Introductory Note~>\n\nBetween the ~<Thrymskvitha~> and the ~<Alvissmol~> in the ~<Codex~> ~<Regius~> stands the ~<Völundarkvitha~>. It was also included in the ~<Arnamagnæan~> ~<Codex~>, but unluckily it begins at the very end of the fragment which has been preserved, and thus only a few lines of the opening prose remain. This is doubly regrettable because the text in ~<Regius~> is unquestionably in very bad shape, and the other manuscript would doubtless have been of great assistance in the reconstruction of the poem.\n\nThere has been a vast amount written regarding the Weland tradition as a whole, discussing particularly the relations between the ~<Völundarkvitha~> and the Weland passage in ~<Deor's~> ~<Lament~>. There can be little question that the story came to the North from Saxon regions, along with many of the other early hero tales. In stanza 16 the Rhine is specifically mentioned as the home of treasure; and the presence of the story in Anglo-Saxon poetry probably as early as the first part of the eighth century proves beyond a doubt that the legend cannot have been a native product of Scandinavia. In one form or another, however, the legend of the smith persisted for centuries throughout all the Teutonic lands, and the name of Wayland Smith is familiar to all readers of Walter Scott, and even of Rudyard Kipling's tales of England.\n\nIn what form this story reached the North is uncertain. Sundry striking parallels between the diction of the ~<Völundarkvitha~> and that of the Weland passage in ~<Deor's~> ~<Lament~> make it distinctly probable that a Saxon song on this subject had found its way to Scandinavia or Iceland. But the prose introduction to the poem mentions the \"old sagas\" in which Völund was celebrated, and in the ~<Thithrekssaga~> we have definite evidence of the existence of such prose narrative in the form of the ~<Velentssaga~> (Velent, Völund, Weland, and Wayland all being, of course, identical), which gives a long story for which the ~<Völundarkvitha~> can have supplied relatively little, if any, of the material. It is probable, then, that Weland stories were current in both prose and verse in Scandinavia as early as the latter part of the ninth century.",
					
					"Once let a figure become popular in oral tradition, and the number and variety of the incidents connected with his name will increase very rapidly. Doubtless there were scores of Weland stories current in the eighth, ninth, and tenth centuries, many of them with very little if any traditional authority. The main one, however, the story of the laming of the smith by King Nithuth (or by some other enemy) and of Weland's terrible revenge, forms the basis of the ~<Völundarkvitha~>. To this, by way of introduction, has been added the story of Völund and the wan-maiden, who, to make things even more complex, is likewise aid to be a Valkyrie. Some critics maintain that these two sections were originally two distinct poems, merely strung together by the compiler with the help of narrative prose links; but the poem as a whole has a kind of dramatic unity which suggests rather that an early poet--for linguistically the poem belongs among the oldest of the Eddic collection--used two distinct legends, whether in prose or verse, as the basis for the composition of a new and homogeneous poem.\n\nThe swan-maiden story appears, of course, in many places quite distinct from the Weland tradition, and, in another form, became one of the most popular of German folk tales. Like the story of Weland, however, it is of German rather than Scandinavian origin, and the identification of the swan-maidens as Valkyries, which may have taken place before the legend reached the North, may, on the other hand, have been simply an attempt to connect southern tradition with figures well known in northern mythology.\n\nThe ~<Völundarkvitha~> is full of prose narrative links, including an introduction. The nature of such prose links has already been discussed in the introductory note to the ~<Grimnismol~>; the ~<Völundarkvitha~> is a striking illustration of the way in which the function of the earlier Eddic verse was limited chiefly to dialogue or description, the narrative outline being provided, if at all, in prose. This prose was put in by each reciter according to his fancy and knowledge, and his estimate of his hearers' need for such explanations; some of it, as in this instance, eventually found its way into the written record.\n\nThe manuscript of the ~<Völundarkvitha~> is in such bad shape, and the conjectural emendations have been so numerous, that in the notes I have attempted to record only the most important of them.",
					
					"There was a king in Sweden named Nithuth. He had two sons and one daughter; her name was Bothvild. There were three brothers, sons of a king of the Finns: one was called Slagfith, another Egil, the third Völund. They went on snowshoes and hunted wild beasts. They came into Ulfdalir and there they built themselves a house; there was a lake there which is called Ulfsjar. Early one morning they found on the shore of the lake three women, who were spinning flax. Near them were their swan garments, for they were Valkyries. Two of them were daughters of King Hlothver, Hlathguth the Swan-White and Hervor the All-Wise, and the third was Olrun, daughter of Kjar from Valland. These did they bring\n\n[~<Prose~>. ~<Nithuth> (\"Bitter Hater\"): here identified as a king of Sweden, is in the poem (stanzas 9, 15 and 32) called lord of the Njars, which may refer to the people of the Swedish district of Nerike. In any case, the scene of the story has moved from Saxon lands into the Northeast. The first and last sentences of the introduction refer to the second part of the poem; the rest of it concerns the swan-maidens episode. ~<Bothvild~> (\"Warlike Maid\"): Völund's victim in the latter part of the poem. ~<King~> ~<of~> ~<the~> ~<Finns~>: this notion, clearly later than the poem, which calls Völund an elf, may perhaps be ascribed to the annotator who composed the prose introduction. The Finns, meaning the dwellers in Lapland, were generally credited with magic powers. ~<Egil~> appears in the ~<Thithrekssaga~> as Völund's brother, but ~<Slagfith~> is not elsewhere mentioned. ~<Ulfdalir~> (\"Wolf-Dale\"), ~<Ulfsjar~> (\"Wolf-Sea\"), ~<Valland~> (\"Slaughter-Land\"): mythical, places without historical identification. ~<Valkyries~>: cf. ~<Voluspo~>, 31 and note; there is nothing in the poem to identify the three swan maidens as Valkyries except one obscure word in line 2 of stanza 1 and again in line 5 of stanza 5, which may mean, as Gering translates it, \"helmed,\" or else \"fair and wise.\" I suspect that the annotator, anxious to give the Saxon legend as much northern local color as possible, was mistaken in his mythology, and that]",
					
					"home to their hall with them. Egil took Olrun, and Slagfith Swan-White, and Völund All-Wise. There they dwelt seven winters; but then they flew away to find battles, and came back no more. Then Egil set forth on his snowshoes to follow Olrun, and Slagfith followed Swan White, but Völund stayed in Ulfdalir. He was a most skillful man, as men know from old tales. King Nithuth had him taken by force, as the poem here tells.\n\n1. Maids from the south | through Myrkwood flew,\nFair and young, | their fate to follow;\nOn the shore of the sea | to rest them they sat,\nThe maids of the south, | and flax they spun.\n\n[the poet never conceived of his swan-maidens as Valkyries at all. However, this identification of swan-maidens with Valkyries was not uncommon; cf. ~<Helreith~> ~<Brynhildar~>, 7. The three maidens' names, ~<Hlathguth~>, ~<Hervor~>, and ~<Olrun~>, do not appear in the lists of Valkyries. ~<King~> ~<Hlothver~>: this name suggests the southern origin of the story, as it is the northern form of Ludwig; the name appears again in ~<Guthrunarkvitha~> II, 26, and that of ~<Kjar~> is found in ~<Atlakvitha~>, 7, both of these poems being based on German stories. It is worth noting that the composer of this introductory note seems to have had little or no information beyond what was actually contained in the poem as it has come down to us; he refers to the \"old stories\" about Völund, but either he was unfamiliar with them in detail or else he thought it needless to make use of them. His note simply puts in clear and connected form what the verse tells somewhat obscurely; his only additions are making Nithuth a king of Sweden and Völund's father a king of the Finns, supplying the name Ulfsjar for the lake, identifying the swan-maidens as Valkyries, and giving Kjar a home in Valland.\n\n1.

In the manuscript these two lines stand after stanza 16; editors have tried to fit them into various places, but the prose indicates that they belong here, with a gap assumed.\n\n3. In the manuscript these two lines follow stanza 1, with no gap indicated, and the first line marked as the beginning of a stanza. Many editors have combined them with stanza 4.\n\n4. No lacuna indicated in the manuscript; one editor fills the stanza out with a second line running: \"Then to her breast Slagfith embraced.\"\n\n5. Line 3 looks like an interpolation, but line 5, identical with line 2 of stanza 1, may be the superfluous one.]",

Some of those who do not include it reject line 4, and combine the remainder of the stanza with all or part of stanza 7.\n\n7. The manuscript marks the second, and not the first, line as the beginning of a stanza. Some editors combine lines 2-3 with all or part of stanza 8. No gap is indicated in the manuscript, but many editors have assumed one, some of them accepting Bugge's suggested \"Till back the maiden bright should come.\"\n\n8. No line in this stanza is indicated in the manuscript as be ginning a new stanza; editors have tried all sorts of experiments in regrouping the lines into stanzas with those of stanzas 7 and 9. In line 3 the word long is sheer guesswork, as the line in the manuscript contains a metrical error.\n\n9. Some editors combine the first two lines with parts of stanza 8, and the last two with the first half of stanza 10. ~<Njars~>:]",

Some editors combine lines 3-4 with the fragmentary stanza 11.\n\n11. No gap indicated in the manuscript; some editors combine these lines with lines 3-4 of stanza to, while others combine them with the first two lines of stanza 12. The one ring which Nithuth's men steal is given to Bothvild, and proves the cause of her undoing.\n\n12. The manuscript indicates line 3, and not line 1, as the beginning of a stanza, which has given rise to a large amount of conjectural rearrangement. Line 2 of the original is identical with the phrase added by Bugge in stanza 6. Line 5 may be]",

In this poem the manuscript indicates the speakers. Some editors make lines 1-2 into a separate stanza, linking lines 3-5 (or 4-5) with stanza 16. Line 3 is very possibly spurious, a mere expansion of \"Nithuth spake.\" Nithuth, of course, has come with his men to capture Völund, and now charges him with having stolen his treasure.\n\n16. The manuscript definitely assigns this stanza to Völund, but many editors give the first two lines to Nithuth. In the manuscript]",

If lines 1-2 belong to Völund, they mean that Nithuth got his wealth in the Rhine country, and that Völund's hoard has nothing to do with it; if the speaker is Nithuth, they mean that Völund presumably has not killed a dragon, and that he is far from the wealth of the Rhine, so that he must have stolen his treasure from Nithuth himself.\n\n17. Line 1 is lacking in the manuscript, lines 2-4 following immediately after the two lines here given as stanza 2. Line 1, borrowed from line I of stanza 32, is placed here by many editors, following Bugge's suggestion. Certainly it is Nithuth's wife who utters line 4. ~<Who~> ~<comes~> ~<from~> ~<the~> ~<wood~>: Völund, noted as a hunter. Gering assumes that with the entrance of Nithuth's wife the scene has changed from Völund's house to Nithuth's, but I cannot see that this is necessary.\n\n~<Prose~>. The annotator inserted this note rather clumsily in the midst of the speech of Nithuth's wife.]",

There he smithied for the king all kinds of precious things. No man dared to go to him, save only the king himself. Völund spake:\n\n19. \"At Nithuth's girdle | gleams the sword\nThat I sharpened keen | with cunningest craft,\n(And hardened the steel | with highest skill;)\nThe bright blade far | forever is borne,\n(Nor back shall I see it | borne to my smithy;)\nNow Bothvild gets | the golden ring\n(That was once my bride's,-- | ne'er well shall it be.)\"\n\n[18. In the manuscript lines 2-3 stand before line 1; many editors have made the transposition here indicated. Some editors reject line 3 as spurious. ~<Sævarstath~>: \"Sea-Stead.\"\n\n19.

Vigfusson makes two stanzas of it by adding a first line: \"Then did Völund speak, | sagest of elves.\" Editors have rejected various lines, and some have regrouped the last lines with the first two of]",

The elimination of the passages in parenthesis produces a four-line stanza which is metrically correct, but it has little more than guesswork to support it.\n\n20. The editions vary radically in combining the lines of this stanza with those of stanzas 19 and 21, particularly as the manuscript indicates the third line as the beginning of a stanza. The meaning, however, remains unchanged.\n\n21. Several editions make one stanza out of lines 1-4 of stanza 20 and lines 1-2 of stanza 21, and another out of the next four lines. ~<The~> ~<evil~> ~<was~> ~<open~>: i.e., the gold in the chest was destined to be their undoing.\n\n22. The manuscript indicates line 3 as the beginning of a stanza, and several editors have adopted this grouping. In the ~<Thithrekssaga~> Völund sends the boys away with instructions not to come back until just after a fall of snow, and then to approach his dwelling walking backward. The boys do this, and when, after he has killed them, Völund is questioned regarding them, he points to the tracks in the snow as evidence that they had left his house.]",

Something has probably been lost before this stanza, explaining how Völund made himself wings, as otherwise, owing to his lameness, he could not leave the island. The ~<Thithrekssaga~> tells the story of how Völund's brother, Egil, shot birds and gave him the feathers, out of which he made a feather-garment. This break in the narrative illustrates the lack of knowledge apparently possessed by the compiler who was responsible for the prose notes; had he known the story told in the ~<Thithrekssaga~>, it is hardly conceivable that he would have failed to indicate the necessary connecting link at this point. Some editors reject line 3 as spurious. The manuscript does not indicate any lacuna.\n\n32. The manuscript indicates line 4 as the beginning of a stanza, and many editors have followed this arrangement.\n\n33. The manuscript does not name the speaker.

Either line 4 or line 5 may be an interpolation; two editions reject lines 3-5, combining lines 1-2 with stanza 40. In the ~<Thithrekssaga~> Nithuth actually compels Egil, Völund's brother, to shoot at Völund. The latter has concealed a bladder full of blood under his left arm, and when his brother's arrow pierces this, Nithuth assumes that his enemy has been killed. This episode likewise appears among the scenes from Völund's career rudely carved on an ancient casket of ivory, bearing an Anglo-Saxon inscription in runic letters, which has been preserved.\n\n40. Line 1: cf. stanza 3 1. The manuscript indicates no lacuna.]",

The first line is a conjectural addition. ~<Thakkrath~> is probably the northern form of the Middle High German name Dancrat.\n\n42. The manuscript indicates no gap, but indicates line 3 as the beginning of a stanza; Vigfusson's added \"Then Nithuth spake, lord of the Njars\" seems plausible enough.\n\n43. The manuscript does not name the speaker. Different editors have rejected one or another of the last three lines, and as the manuscript indicates line 4 as the beginning of a new stanza, the loss of two or three lines has likewise been suggested. According to the ~<Thithrekssaga~>, the son of Völund and Bothvild was Vithga, or Witege, one of the heroes of Dietrich of Bern.]"
