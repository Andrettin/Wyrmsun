					"There is scarcely any literary work of great importance which has been less readily available for the general reader, or even for the serious student of literature, than the Poetic Edda. Translations have been far from numerous, and only in Germany has the complete work of translation been done in the full light of recent scholarship. In English the only versions were long the conspicuously inadequate one made by Thorpe, and published about half a century ago, and the unsatisfactory prose translations in Vigfusson and Powell's ~<Corpus Poeticum Boreale~>, reprinted in the Norroena collection. An excellent translation of the poems dealing with the gods, in verse and with critical and explanatory notes, made by Olive Bray, was, however, published by the Viking Club of London in 1908. In French there exist only partial translations, chief among them being those made by Bergmann many years ago. Among the seven or eight German versions, those by the Brothers Grimm and by Karl Simrock, which had considerable historical importance because of their influence on nineteenth century German literature and art, and particularly on the work of Richard Wagner, have been largely superseded by Hugo Gering's admirable translation, published in 1892, and by the recent two volume rendering by Genzmer, with excellent notes by Andreas Heusler, 194-1920. There are competent translations in both Norwegian and Swedish. The lack of any complete and adequately annotated English rendering in metrical form, based on a critical text, and profiting by the cumulative labors of such scholars as Mogk, Vigfusson,",
					
					"Finnur Jonsson, Grundtvig, Bugge, Gislason, Hildebrand, Lüning, Sweet, Niedner, Ettmüller, Müllenhoff, Edzardi, B. M. Olsen, Sievers, Sijmons, Detter, Heinzel, Falk, Neckel, Heusler, and Gering, has kept this extraordinary work practically out of the reach of those who have had neither time nor inclination to master the intricacies of the original Old Norse. \n\nOn the importance of the material contained in the ~<Poetic Edda~> it is here needless to dwell at any length. We have inherited the Germanic traditions in our very speech, and the ~<Poetic Edda~> is the original storehouse of Germanic mythology. It is, indeed, in many ways the greatest literary monument preserved to us out of the antiquity of the kindred races which we call Germanic. Moreover, it has a literary value altogether apart from its historical significance. The mythological poems include, in the ~<Voluspo~>, one of the vastest conceptions of the creation and ultimate destruction of the world ever crystallized in literary form; in parts of the ~<Hovamol~>, a collection of wise counsels that can bear comparison with most of the Biblical Book of Proverbs; in the ~<Lokasenna~>, a comedy none the less full of vivid characterization because its humor is often broad; and in the ~<Thrymskvitha~>, one of the finest ballads in the world. The hero poems give us, in its oldest and most vivid extant form, the story of Sigurth, Brynhild, and Atli, the Norse parallel to the German ~<Nibelungenlied~>. The Poetic Edda is not only of great interest to the student of antiquity; it is a collection including some of the most remark able poems which have been preserved to us from the period before the pen and the printing-press. replaced the poet-singer and oral tradition. It is above all else the desire",
					
					"to make better known the dramatic force, the vivid and often tremendous imagery, and the superb conceptions embodied in these poems which has called forth the present translation. \n\n~<What is the Poetic Edda?~>\n\nEven if the poems of the so-called Edda were not so significant and intrinsically so valuable, the long series of scholarly struggles which have been going on over them for the better part of three centuries would in itself give them a peculiar interest. Their history is strangely mysterious. We do not know who composed them, or when or where they were composed; we are by no means sure who collected them or when he did so; finally, we are not absolutely certain as to what an \"Edda\" is, and the best guess at the meaning of the word renders its application to this collection of poems more or less misleading. \n\nA brief review of the chief facts in the history of the ~<Poetic Edda~> will explain why this uncertainty has persisted. Preserved in various manuscripts of the thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries is a prose work consisting of a very extensive collection of mythological stories, an explanation of the important figures and tropes of Norse poetic diction,--the poetry of the Icelandic and Norwegian skalds was appallingly complex in this respect,--and a treatise on metrics. This work, clearly a handbook for poets, was commonly known as the \"Edda\" of Snorri Sturluson, for at the head of the copy of it in the ~<Uppsalabok~>, a manuscript written presumably some fifty or sixty years after Snorri's death, which was in 1241, we find: \"This book is called Edda, which Snorri Sturluson composed.\" This work, well known as the ~<Prose Edda~>, Snorri's ~<Edda~> or the",
					
					"~<Younger Edda~>, has recently been made available to readers of English in the admirable translation by Arthur G. Brodeur, published by the American-Scandinavian Foundation in 1916.\n\nIcelandic tradition, however, persisted in ascribing either this ~<Edda~> or one resembling it to Snorri's much earlier compatriot, Sæmund the Wise (1056-1133). When, early in the seventeenth century, the learned Arngrimur Jonsson proved to everyone's satisfaction that Snorri and nobody else must have been responsible for the work in question, the next thing to determine was what, if anything, Sæmund had done of the same kind. The nature of Snorri's book gave a clue. In the mythological stories related a number of poems were quoted, and as these and other poems were to all appearances Snorri's chief sources of information, it was assumed that Sæmund must have written or compiled a verse ~<Edda~>--whatever an \"Edda\" might be--on which Snorri's work was largely based.\n\nSo matters stood when, in 1643, Brynjolfur Sveinsson, Bishop of Skalholt, discovered a manuscript, clearly written as early as 1300, containing twenty-nine poems, complete or fragmentary, and some of them with the very lines and stanzas used by Snorri. Great was the joy of the scholars, for here, of course, must be at least a part of the long-sought ~<Edda~> of Sæmund the Wise. Thus the good bishop promptly labeled his find, and as Sæmund's ~<Edda~>, the ~<Elder Edda~> or the ~<Poetic Edda~> it has been known to this day.\n\nThis precious manuscript, now in the Royal Library in Copenhagen, and known as the ~<Codex~> ~<Regius~> (R2365), has been the basis for all published editions of the Eddic poems. A few poems of similar character found elsewhere",
					
					"have subsequently been added to the collection, until now most editions include, as in this translation, a total of thirty-four. A shorter manuscript now in the Arnamagnæan collection in Copenhagen (AM748), contains fragmentary or complete versions of six of the poems in the ~<Codex Regius~>, and one other, ~<Baldrs Draumar~>, not found in that collection. Four other poems (~<Rigsthula~>, ~<Hyndluljoth~>, ~<Grougaldr~> and ~<Fjolsvinnsmol~>, the last two here combined under the title of Svipdagsmol), from various manuscripts, so closely resemble in subject-matter and style the poems in the ~<Codex Regius~> that they have been included by most editors in the collection. Finally, Snorri's ~<Edda~> contains one complete poem, the ~<Grottasongr~>, which many editors have added to the poetic collection; it is, however, not included in this translation, as an admirable English version of it is available in Mr. Brodeur's rendering of Snorri's work.\n\nFrom all this it is evident that the ~<Poetic Edda~>, as we now know it, is no definite and plainly limited work, but rather a more or less haphazard collection of separate poems, dealing either with Norse mythology or with hero-cycles unrelated to the traditional history of greater Scandinavia or Iceland. How many other similar poems, now lost, may have existed in such collections as were current in Iceland in the later twelfth and thirteenth centuries we cannot know, though it is evident that some poems of this type are missing. We can say only that thirty-four poems have been preserved, twenty-nine of them in a single manuscript collection, which differ considerably in subject-matter and style from all the rest of extant Old Norse poetry, and these we group together as the ~<Poetic Edda~>.",
					
					"But what does the word \"Edda\" mean? Various guesses have been made. An early assumption was that the word somehow meant \"Poetics,\" which fitted Snorri's treatise to a nicety, but which, in addition to the lack of philological evidence to support this interpretation, could by no stretch of scholarly subtlety be made appropriate to the collection of poems. Jacob Grimm ingeniously identified the word with the word \"edda\" used in one of the poems, the ~<Rigsthula~>, where, rather conjecturally, it means \"great-grand mother.\" The word exists in this sense no where else in Norse literature, and Grimm's suggestion of \"Tales of a Grandmother,\" though at one time it found wide acceptance, was grotesquely inappropriate to either the prose or the verse work.\n\nAt last Eirikr Magnusson hit on what appears the likeliest solution of the puzzle: that \"Edda\" is simply the genitive form of the proper name \"Oddi.\" Oddi was a settlement in the southwest of Iceland, certainly the home of Snorri Sturluson for many years, and, traditionally at least, also the home of Sæmund the Wise. That Snorri's work should have been called \"The Book of Oddi\" is altogether reasonable, for such a method of naming books was common--witness the \"Book of the Flat Island\" and other early manuscripts. That Sæmund may also have written or compiled another \"Oddi-Book\" is perfectly possible, and that tradition should have said he did so is entirely natural.\n\nIt is, however, an open question whether or not Sæmund had anything to do with making the collection, or any part of it, now known as the Poetic Edda, for of course the seventeenth-century assignment of the work to him is negligible.",
					
					"We can say only that he may have made some such compilation, for he was a diligent student of Icelandic tradition and history, and was famed throughout the North for his learning. But otherwise no trace of his works survives, and as he was educated in Paris, it is probable that he wrote rather in Latin than in the vernacular.\n\nAll that is reasonably certain is that by the middle or last of the twelfth century there existed in Iceland one or more written collections of Old Norse mythological and heroic poems, that the ~<Codex Regius~>, a copy made a hundred years or so later, represents at least a considerable part of one of these, and that the collection of thirty-four poems which we now know as the ~<Poetic~> or ~<Elder Edda~> is practically all that has come down to us of Old Norse poetry of this type. Anything more is largely guesswork, and both the name of the compiler and the meaning of the title \"Edda\" are conjectural.\n\n~<The Origin of the Eddic Poems~>\n\nThere is even less agreement about the birthplace, authorship and date of the Eddic poems themselves than about the nature of the existing collection. Clearly the poems were the work of many different men, living in different periods; clearly, too, most of them existed in oral tradition for generations before they were committed to writing. In general, the mythological poems seem strongly marked by pagan sincerity, although efforts have been made to prove them the results of deliberate archaizing; and as Christianity became generally accepted throughout the Norse world early in the eleventh century, it seems altogether likely that most of the poems dealing",
					
					"with the gods definitely antedate the year 1000. The earlier terminus is still a matter of dispute. The general weight of critical opinion, based chiefly on the linguistic evidence presented by Hoffory, Finnur Jonsson and others, has indicated that the poems did not assume anything closely analogous to their present forms prior to the ninth century. On the other hand, Magnus Olsen's interpretation of the inscriptions on the Eggjum Stone, which he places as early as the seventh century, have led so competent a scholar as Birger Nerman to say that \"we may be warranted in concluding that some of the Eddic poems may have originated, wholly or partially, in the second part of the seventh century.\" As for the poems belonging to the hero cycles, one or two of them appear to be as late as 1100, but most of them probably date back at least to the century and a half following 900. It is a reasonable guess that the years between 850 and 1050 saw the majority of the Eddic poems worked into definite shape, but it must be remembered that many changes took place during the long subsequent period of oral transmission, and also that many of the legends, both mythological and heroic, on which the poems were based certainly existed in the Norse regions, and quite possibly in verse form, long before the year 900.\n\nAs to the origin of the legends on which the poems are based, the whole question, at least so far as the stories of the gods are concerned, is much too complex for discussion here. How much of the actual narrative material of the mythological lays is properly to be called Scandinavian is a matter for students of comparative mythology to",
					
					"guess at. The tales underlying the heroic lays are clearly of foreign origin: the Helgi story comes from Denmark, and that of Völund from Germany, as also the great mass of traditions centering around Sigurth (Siegfried), Brynhild, the sons of Gjuki, Atli (Attila), and Jormunrek (Ermanarich). The introductory notes to the various poems deal with the more important of these questions of origin. of the men who composed these poems,--\"wrote\" is obviously the wrong word--we know absolutely nothing, save that some of them must have been literary artists with a high degree of conscious skill. The Eddic poems are \"folk-poetry,\"--whatever that may be,--only in the sense that some of them strongly reflect racial feelings and beliefs; they are anything but crude or primitive in workmanship, and they show that not only the poets themselves, but also many of their hearers, must have made a careful study of the art of poetry.\n\nWhere the poems were shaped is equally uncertain. Any date prior to 875 would normally imply an origin on the mainland, but the necessarily fluid state of oral tradition made it possible for a poem to be \"composed\" many times over, and in various and far-separated places, without altogether losing its identity. Thus, even if a poem first assumed something approximating its present form in Iceland in the tenth century, it may none the less embody language characteristic of Norway two centuries earlier. Oral poetry has always had an amazing preservative power over language, and in considering the origins of such poems as these, we must cease thinking in terms of the printing-press, or even in those of the scribe. The",
					
					"claims of Norway as the birthplace of most of the Eddic poems have been extensively advanced, but the great literary activity of Iceland after the settlement of the island by Norwegian emigrants late in the ninth century makes the theory of an Icelandic home for many of the poems appear plausible. The two Atli lays, with what authority we do not know, bear in the ~<Codex Regius~> the superscription \"the Greenland poem,\" and internal evidence suggests that this statement may be correct. Certainly in one poem, the ~<Rigsthula~>, and probably in several others, there are marks of Celtic influence. During a considerable part of the ninth and tenth centuries, Scandinavians were active in Ireland and in most of the western islands inhabited by branches of the Celtic race. Some scholars have, indeed, claimed nearly all the Eddic poems for these \"Western Isles.\" However, as Iceland early came to be the true cultural center of this Scandinavian island world, it may be said that the preponderant evidence concerning the development of the Eddic poems in anything like their present form points in that direction, and certainly it was in Iceland that they were chiefly preserved.\n\n~<The Edda and Old Norse Literature~>\n\nWithin the proper limits of an introduction it would be impossible to give any adequate summary of the history and literature with which the Eddic poems are indissolubly connected, but a mere mention of a few of the salient facts may be of some service to those who are unfamiliar with the subject. Old Norse literature covers approximately the period between 850 and 1300. During the first part of",
					
					"that period occurred the great wanderings of the Scandinavian peoples, and particularly the Norwegians. A convenient date to remember is that of the sea-fight of Hafrsfjord, 872, when Harald the Fair-Haired broke the power of the independent Norwegian nobles, and made himself overlord of nearly all the country. Many of the defeated nobles fled overseas, where inviting refuges had been found for them by earlier wanderers and plunder-seeking raiders. This was the time of the inroads of the dreaded Northmen in France, and in 885 Hrolf Gangr (Rollo) laid siege to Paris itself. Many Norwegians went to Ireland, where their compatriots had already built Dublin, and where they remained in control of most of the island till Brian Boru shattered their power at the battle of Clontarf in 1014.\n\nOf all the migrations, however, the most important were those to Iceland. Here grew up an active civilization, fostered by absolute independence and by remoteness from the wars which wracked Norway, yet kept from degenerating into provincialism by the roving life of the people, which brought them constantly in contact with the culture of the South. Christianity, introduced throughout the Norse world about the year 1000, brought with it the stability of learning, and the Icelanders became not only the makers but also the students and recorders of history. The years between 875 and 1100 were the great spontaneous period of oral literature. Most of the military and political leaders were also poets, and they composed a mass of lyric poetry concerning the authorship of which we know a good deal, and much of which has been preserved. Narrative",
					
					"prose also flourished, for the Icelander had a passion for story-telling and story-hearing. After 1100 came the day of the writers. These sagamen collected the material that for generations had passed from mouth to mouth, and gave it permanent form in writing. The greatest bulk of what we now have of Old Norse literature,--and the published part of it makes a formidable library,--originated thus in the earlier period before the introduction of writing, and was put into final shape by the scholars, most of them Icelanders, of the hundred years following 1150.\n\nAfter 1250 came a rapid and tragic decline. Iceland lost its independence, becoming a Norwegian province. Later Norway too fell under alien rule, a Swede ascending the Norwegian throne in 1320. Pestilence and famine laid waste the whole North; volcanic disturbances worked havoc in Iceland. Literature did not quite die, but it fell upon evil days; for the vigorous native narratives and heroic poems of the older period were substituted translations of French romances. The poets wrote mostly doggerel; the prose writers were devoid of national or racial inspiration.\n\nThe mass of literature thus collected and written down largely between 1150 and 1250 maybe roughly divided into four groups. The greatest in volume is made up of the sagas: narratives mainly in prose, ranging all the way from authentic history of the Norwegian kings and the early Icelandic settlements to fairy-tales. Embodied in the sagas is found the material composing the second group: the skaldic poetry, a vast collection of songs of praise, triumph, love, lamentation, and so on, almost uniformly characterized",
					
					"by an appalling complexity of figurative language. There is no absolute line to be drawn between the poetry of the skalds and the poems of the ~<Edda~>, which we may call the third group; but in addition to the remarkable artificiality of style which marks the skaldic poetry, and which is seldom found in the poems of the ~<Edda~>, the skalds dealt almost exclusively with their own emotions, whereas the Eddic poems are quite impersonal. Finally, there is the fourth group, made up of didactic works, religious and legal treatises, and so on, studies which originated chiefly in the later period of learned activity.\n\n~<Preservation of the Eddic Poems~>\n\nMost of the poems of the ~<Poetic Edda~> have unquestionably reached us in rather bad shape. During the long period of oral transmission they suffered all sorts of interpolations, omissions and changes, and some of them, as they now stand, are a bewildering hodge-podge of little related fragments. To some extent the diligent twelfth century compiler to whom we owe the ~<Codex Regius~>--Sæmund or another--was himself doubtless responsible for the patchwork process, often supplemented by narrative prose notes of his own; but in the days before written records existed, it was easy to lose stanzas and longer passages from their context, and equally easy to interpolate them where they did not by any means belong. Some few of the poems, however, appear to be virtually complete and unified as we now have them.\n\nUnder such circumstances it is clear that the establishment of a satisfactory text is a matter of the utmost difficulty. As the basis for this translation I have used the text",
					
					"prepared by Karl Hildebrand (1876) and revised by Hugo Gering (1904). Textual emendation has, however, been so extensive in every edition of the ~<Edda~>, and has depended so much on the theories of the editor, that I have also made extensive use of many other editions, notably those by Finnur Jonsson, Neckel, Sijmons, and Detter and Heinzel, together with numerous commentaries. The condition of the text in both the principal codices is such that no great reliance can be placed on the accuracy of the copyists, and frequently two editions will differ fundamentally as to their readings of a given passage or even of an entire-poem. For this reason, and because guesswork necessarily plays so large a part in any edition or translation of the Eddic poems, I have risked overloading the pages with textual notes in order to show, as nearly as possible, the exact state of the original together with all the more significant emendations. I have done this particularly in the case of transpositions, many of which appear absolutely necessary, and in the indication of passages which appear to be interpolations.\n\n~<The Verse-Forms of the Eddic Poems~>\n\nThe many problems connected with the verse-forms found in the Eddic poems have been analyzed in great detail by Sievers, Neckel, and others. The three verse-forms exemplified in the poems need only a brief comment here, however, in order to make clear the method used in this translation. All of these forms group the lines normally in four-line stanzas. In the so-called Fornyrthislag (\"Old Verse\"), for convenience sometimes referred to in the notes as four-four measure, these lines have all the same",
					
					"structure, each line being sharply divided by a cæsural pause into two half-lines, and each half-line having two accented syllables and two (sometimes three) unaccented ones. The two half-lines forming a complete line are bound together by the alliteration, or more properly initial-rhyme, of three (or two) of the accented syllables. The following is an example of the Fornyrthislag stanza, the accented syllables being in italics:\n\n\t\t~<VreiÞr~> vas ~<Ving~>Þórr, | es ~<vakna~>Þi\n\t\tok ~<síns ham~>ars | of ~<sakna~>Þi;\n\t\t~<skegg~> nam ~<hris~>ta, | ~<skor~> nam ~<dý~>ja,\n\t\t~<ré~>Þ ~<JarÞ~>ar ~<burr~> | ~<umb~> at ~<Þreif~>ask.\n\nIn the second form, the Ljothahattr (\"Song Measure\"), the first and third line of each stanza are as just described, but the second and fourth are shorter, have no cæsural pause, have three accented syllables, and regularly two initial-rhymed accented syllables, for which reason I have occasionally referred to Ljothahattr as four-three measure. The following is an example:\n\n\t\t~<Ar~> skal ~<rí~>sa | sás ~<an~>nars ~<vill~>\n\t\t\t~<fé~> eÞa ~<fior haf~>a;\n\t\t~<ligg~>jandi ~<ulfr~> | sjaldan ~<láer~> of ~<getr~>\n\t\t\tné ~<sof~>andi ~<maÞr sigr~>.\n\nIn the third and least commonly used form, the Malahattr (\"Speech Measure\"), a younger verse-form than either of the other two, each line of the four-line stanza is divided into two half-lines by a cæsural pause, each half line having two accented syllables and three (sometimes",
					
					"four) unaccented ones; the initial rhyme is as in the Fornyrthislag. The following is an example:\n\n\t\t~<Horsk~> vas ~<hús~>freyja, | ~<hug~>Þi at ~<mann~>viti,\n\t\t~<lag~> heyrÞi ~<ór~>Þa, | hvat á ~<laun máel~>tu;\n\t\tÞá vas ~<vant vit~>ri, | ~<vil~>di Þeim ~<hjalÞ~>a:\n\t\tskyldu of ~<sáe sig~>la, | en ~<sjolf~> né ~<kvamsk~>at.\n\nA poem in Fornyrthislag is normally entitled -~<kvitha~> (~<Thrymskvitha~>, ~<Guthrunarkvitha~>, etc.), which for convenience I have rendered as \"lay,\" while a poem in Ljothahattr is entitled -~<mol~> (~<Grimnismol~>, ~<Skirnismol~>, etc.), which I have rendered as \"ballad.\" It is difficult to find any distinction other than metrical between the two terms, although it is clear that one originally existed.\n\nVariations frequently appear in all three kinds of verse, and these I have attempted to indicate through the rhythm of the translation. In order to preserve so far as possible the effect of the Eddic verse, I have adhered, in making the English version, to certain of the fundamental rules governing the Norse line and stanza formations. The number of lines to each stanza conforms to what seems the best guess as to the original, and I have consistently retained the number of accented syllables. in translating from a highly inflected language into one depending largely on the use of subsidiary words, it has, however, been necessary to employ considerable freedom as to the number of unaccented syllables in a line. The initial-rhyme is generally confined to two accented syllables in each line. As in the original, all initial vowels are allowed to rhyme interchangeably, but I have disregarded the rule which lets certain groups of consonants rhyme only with themselves",

					"~<Voluspo~>\n\n~<The Wise-Woman's Prophecy~>\n\n~<Introductory Note~>\n\nAt the beginning of the collection in the ~<Codex~> ~<Regius~> stands the Voluspo, the most famous and important, as it is likewise the most debated, of all the Eddic poems. Another version of it is found in a huge miscellaneous compilation of about the year 1300, the ~<Hauksbok~>, and many stanzas are included in the ~<Prose Edda~> of Snorri Sturluson. The order of the stanzas in the ~<Hauksbok~> version differs materially from that in the ~<Codex~> ~<Regius~>, and in the published editions many experiments have been attempted in further rearrangements. On the whole, how ever, and allowing for certain interpolations, the order of the stanzas in the ~<Codex~> ~<Regius~> seems more logical than any of the wholesale \"improvements\" which have been undertaken.\n\nThe general plan of the ~<Voluspo~> is fairly clear. Othin, chief of the gods, always conscious of impending disaster and eager for knowledge, calls on a certain \"Volva,\" or wise-woman, presumably bidding her rise from the grave. She first tells him of the past, of the creation of the world, the beginning of years, the origin of the dwarfs (at this point there is a clearly interpolated catalogue of dwarfs' names, stanzas 10-16), of the first man and woman, of the world-ash Yggdrasil, and of the first war, between the gods and the Vanir, or, in Anglicized form, the Wanes. Then, in stanzas 27-29, as a further proof of her wisdom, she discloses some of Othin's own secrets and the details of his search for knowledge. Rewarded by Othin for what she has thus far told (stanza 30), she then turns to the real prophesy, the disclosure of the final destruction of the gods. This final battle, in which fire and flood overwhelm heaven and earth as the gods fight with their enemies, is the great fact in Norse mythology; the phrase describing it, ~<ragna~> ~<rök~>, \"the fate of the gods,\" has become familiar, by confusion with the word rökkr, \"twilight,\" in the German ~<Göterdämmerung~>. The wise-woman tells of the Valkyries who bring the slain warriors to support Othin and the other gods in the battle, of the slaying of Baldr, best and fairest of the gods, through the wiles of Loki, of the enemies of the gods, of the summons to battle on both sides, and of the mighty struggle, till Othin is slain, and \"fire leaps high",
					
					"about heaven itself\" (stanzas 31-58). But this is not all. A new and beautiful world is to rise on the ruins of the old; Baldr comes back, and \"fields unsowed bear ripened fruit\" (stanzas 59-66).\n\nThis final passage, in particular, has caused wide differences of opinion as to the date and character of the poem. That the poet was heathen and not Christian seems almost beyond dispute; there is an intensity and vividness in almost every stanza which no archaizing Christian could possibly have achieved. On the other hand, the evidences of Christian influence are sufficiently striking to outweigh the arguments of Finnur Jonsson, Müllenhoff and others who maintain that the ~<Voluspo~> is purely a product of heathendom. The roving Norsemen of the tenth century, very few of whom had as yet accepted Christianity, were nevertheless in close contact with Celtic races which had already been converted, and in many ways the Celtic influence was strongly felt. It seems likely, then, that the ~<Voluspo~> was the work of a poet living chiefly in Iceland, though possibly in the \"Western Isles,\" in the middle of the tenth century, a vigorous believer in the old gods, and yet with an imagination active enough to be touched by the vague tales of a different religion emanating from his neighbor Celts.\n\nHow much the poem was altered during the two hundred years between its composition and its first being committed to writing is largely a matter of guesswork, but, allowing for such an obvious interpolation as the catalogue of dwarfs, and for occasional lesser errors, it seems quite needless to assume such great changes as many editors do. The poem was certainly not composed to tell a story with which its early hearers were quite familiar; the lack of continuity which baffles modern readers presumably did not trouble them in the least. It is, in effect, a series of gigantic pictures, put into words with a directness and sureness which bespeak the poet of genius. It is only after the reader, with the help of the many notes, has--familiarized him self with the names and incidents involved that he can begin to understand the effect which this magnificent poem must have produced on those who not only understood but believed it.",
					
					"1. Hearing I ask | from the holy races,\nFrom Heimdall's sons, | both high and low;\nThou wilt, Valfather, | that well I relate\nOld tales I remember | of men long ago.\n\n2. I remember yet | the giants of yore,\nWho gave me bread | in the days gone by;\nNine worlds I knew, | the nine in the tree\nWith mighty roots | beneath the mold.\n\n[1. A few editors, following Bugge, in an effort to clarify the poem, place stanzas 22, 28 and 30 before stanzas 1-20, but the arrangement in both manuscripts, followed here, seems logical. In stanza I the Volva, or wise-woman, called upon by Othin, answers him and demands a hearing. Evidently she be longs to the race of the giants (cf. stanza 2), and thus speaks to Othin unwillingly, being compelled to do so by his magic power. Holy: omitted in ~<Regius~>; the phrase \"holy races\" probably means little more than mankind in general. Heimdall: the watchman of the gods; cf. stanza 46 and note. Why mankind should be referred to as Heimdall's sons is uncertain, and the phrase has caused much perplexity. Heimdall seems to have had various at tributes, and in the Rigsthula, wherein a certain Rig appears as the ancestor of the three great classes of men, a fourteenth century annotator identifies Rig with Heimdall, on what authority we do not know, for the Rig of the poem seems much more like Othin (cf. Rigsthula, introductory prose and note). Valfather (\"Father of the Slain\"): Othin, chief of the gods, so called because the slain warriors were brought to him at Valhall (\"Hall of the Slain\") by the Valkyries (\"Choosers of the Slain\").\n\n2. Nine worlds: the worlds of the gods (Asgarth), of the Wanes (Vanaheim, cf. stanza 21 and note), of the elves (Alfheim), of men (Mithgarth), of the giants (Jotunheim), of fire (Muspellsheim, cf. stanza 47 and note), of the dark elves (Svartalfaheim), of the dead (Niflheim), and presumably of the dwarfs (perhaps Nithavellir, cf. stanza 37 and note, but the ninth world is uncertain).

Bur's sons: Othin, Vili, and Ve. Of Bur we know only that his wife was Bestla, daughter of Bolthorn; cf. ~<Hovamol~>, 141. Vili and Ve are mentioned by name in the Eddic poems only in ~<Lokasenna~>, 26. ~<Mithgarth~> (\"Middle Dwelling\"): the world of men. ~<Leeks~>: the leek was often used as the symbol of fine growth (cf. ~<Guthrunarkvitha~> I, 17), and it was also supposed to have magic power (cf. ~<Sigrdrifumol~>, 7).\n\n5. Various editors have regarded this stanza as interpolated; Hoffory thinks it describes the northern summer night in which the sun does not set. Lines 3-5 are quoted by Snorri. In the manuscripts line 4 follows line 5. Regarding the sun and moon]",

Possibly an interpolation, but there seems no strong reason for assuming this. Lines 1-2 are identical with lines 1-2 of stanza 9, and line 2 may have been inserted here from that later stanza.\n\n7. ~<Ithavoll~> (\"Field of Deeds\"?): mentioned only here and in stanza 60 as the meeting-place of the gods; it appears in no other connection.\n\n8. ~<Tables~>: the exact nature of this game, and whether it more closely resembled chess or checkers, has been made the subject of a 400-page treatise, Willard Fiske's \"Chess in Iceland.\" ~<Giant-maids~>: perhaps the three great Norns, corresponding to the three fates; cf. stanza 20, and note. Possibly, however, something has been lost after this stanza, and the missing passage, replaced by the catalogue of the dwarfs (stanzas 9-16), may have explained the \"giant-maids\" otherwise than as Norns. In ~<Vafthruthnismol~>, 49, the Norms (this time \"three throngs\" in stead of simply \"three\") are spoken of as giant-maidens;]",
					
					"9. Then sought the gods | their assembly-seats,\nThe holy ones, | and council held,\nTo find who should raise | the race of dwarfs\nOut of Brimir's blood | and the legs of Blain.\n\n10.

Here apparently begins the interpolated catalogue of the dwarfs, running through stanza 16; possibly, however, the interpolated section does not begin before stanza 11. Snorri quotes practically the entire section, the names appearing in a some what changed order. ~<Brimir~> and ~<Blain~>: nothing is known of these two giants, and it has been suggested that both are names for Ymir (cf. stanza 3). Brimir, however, appears in stanza 37 in connection with the home of the dwarfs. Some editors treat the words as common rather than proper nouns, Brimir meaning \"the bloody moisture\" and Blain being of uncertain significance.\n\n10. Very few of the dwarfs named in this and the following stanzas are mentioned elsewhere. It is not clear why Durin should have been singled out as authority for the list. The occasional repetitions suggest that not all the stanzas of the catalogue came from the same source. Most of the names presumably had some definite significance, as Northri, Suthri, Austri, and Vestri (\"North,\" \"South\", \"East,\" and \"West\"),]",

The order of the lines in this and the succeeding four stanzas varies greatly in the manuscripts and editions, and the names likewise appear in many forms. ~<Regin~>: probably not identical with Regin the son of Hreithmar, who plays an important part in the ~<Reginsmol~> and ~<Fafnismol~>, but cf. note on ~<Reginsmol~>, introductory prose.\n\n14. ~<Dvalin~>: in Hovamol, 144, Dvalin seems to have given magic runes to the dwarfs, probably accounting for their skill in craftsmanship, while in ~<Fafnismol~>, 13, he is mentioned as the father of some of the lesser Norns. The story that some of the dwarfs left the rocks and mountains to find a new home on the sands is mentioned, but unexplained, in Snorri's Edda; of ~<Lofar~> we know only that he was descended from these wanderers.]",

Here the poem resumes its course after the interpolated section. Probably, however, something has been lost, for there is no apparent connection between the three giant-maids of stanza 8 and the three gods, Othin, Hönir and Lothur, who in stanza 17 go forth to create man and woman. The word \"three\" in stanzas 9 and 17 very likely confused some early reciter, or perhaps the compiler himself. ~<Ask~> and ~<Embla~>: ash and elm; Snorri gives them simply as the names of the first man and woman, but says that the gods made this pair out of trees.\n\n18. ~<Hönir~>: little is known of this god, save that he occasionally appears in the poems in company with Othin and Loki, and]",

He was given by the gods as a hostage to the Wanes after their war, in exchange for Njorth (cf. stanza 21 and note). ~<Lothur~>: apparently an older name for Loki, the treacherous but ingenious son of Laufey, whose divinity Snorri regards as somewhat doubtful. He was adopted by Othin, who subsequently had good reason to regret it. Loki probably represents the blending of two originally distinct figures, one of them an old fire-god, hence his gift of heat to the newly created pair.\n\n19. ~<Yggdrasil~>: cf. stanza 2 and note, and ~<Grimnismol~>, 29-35 and notes. Urth (\"The Past\"): one of the three great Norns. The world-ash is kept green by being sprinkled with the marvelous healing water from her well.\n\n20. ~<The maidens~>: the three Norns; possibly this stanza should follow stanza 8. ~<Dwelling~>: ~<Regius~> has \"sae\" (sea) instead of \"sal\" (hall, home), and many editors have followed this reading, although Snorri's prose paraphrase indicates \"sal.\" ~<Urth,~> ~<Verthandi~> ~<and~> ~<Skuld~>: \"Past,\" \"Present\" and \"Future.\" ~<Wood~>, etc.: the magic signs (runes) controlling the destinies of men were cut on pieces of wood.

Heith they named her | who sought their home,\nThe wide-seeing witch, | in magic wise;\nMinds she bewitched | that were moved by her magic,\nTo evil women | a joy she was.\n\n[21. This follows stanza 20 in ~<Regius~>; in the ~<Hauksbok~> version stanzas 25, 26, 27, 40, and 41 come between stanzas 20 and 21. Editors have attempted all sorts of rearrangements. ~<The war~>: the first war was that between the gods and the Wanes. The cult of the Wanes (Vanir) seems to have originated among the seafaring folk of the Baltic and the southern shores of the North Sea, and to have spread thence into Norway in opposition to the worship of the older gods; hence the \"war.\" Finally the two types of divinities were worshipped in common; hence the treaty which ended the war with the exchange of hostages. Chief among the Wanes were Njorth and his children, Freyr and Freyja, all of whom became conspicuous among the gods. Beyond this we know little of the Wanes, who seem originally to have been water-deities. ~<I remember~>: the manuscripts have \"she remembers,\" but the Volva is apparently still speaking of her own memories, as in stanza 2. ~<Gollveig~> (\"Gold-Might\"): apparently the first of the Wanes to come among the gods, her ill treatment being the immediate cause of the war. Müllenhoff maintains that Gollveig is another name for Freyja. Lines 5-6, one or both of them probably interpolated, seem to symbolize the refining of gold by fire. ~<Hor~> (\"The High One\"): Othin.\n\n22. ~<Heith~> (\"Shining One\"?): a name often applied to wise women and prophetesses.

It is also possible that the stanza is an interpolation. Bugge maintains that it applies to the Volva who is reciting the poem, and makes it the opening stanza, following it with stanzas 28 and 30, and then going on with stanzas I ff. The text of line 2 is obscure, and has been variously emended.\n\n23. This stanza and stanza 24 have been transposed from the order in the manuscripts, for the former describes the battle and the victory of the Wanes, after which the gods took council, debating whether to pay tribute to the victors, or to admit them, as was finally done, to equal rights of worship.\n\n25. Possibly, as Finn Magnusen long ago suggested, there is something lost after stanza 24, but it was not the custom of the Eddic poets to supply transitions which their hearers could generally be counted on to understand. The story referred to in stanzas 25-26 (both quoted by Snorri) is that of the rebuilding of Asgarth after its destruction by the Wanes. The gods employed a giant as builder, who demanded as his reward the sun and moon, and the goddess Freyja for his wife. The gods, terrified by the rapid progress of the work, forced Loki, who had advised the bargain, to delay the giant by a trick, so that the]",

The enraged giant then threatened the gods, whereupon Thor slew him. ~<Oth's~> ~<bride~>: Freyja; of Oth little is known beyond the fact that Snorri refers to him as a man who \"went away on long journeys.\"\n\n26. ~<Thor~>: the thunder-god, son of Othin and Jorth (Earth) cf. particularly Harbarthsljoth and Thrymskvitha, passim. ~<Oaths~>, etc.: the gods, by violating their oaths to the giant who rebuilt Asgarth, aroused the undying hatred of the giants' race, and thus the giants were among their enemies in the final battle.\n\n27. Here the Volva turns from her memories of the past to a statement of some of Othin's own secrets in his eternal search for knowledge (stanzas 27-29). Bugge puts this stanza after stanza 29. ~<The~> ~<horn~> ~<of~> ~<Heimdall~>: the Gjallarhorn (\"Shrieking Horn\"), with which Heimdall, watchman of the gods, will summon them to the last battle. Till that time the horn is buried under Yggdrasil. ~<Valfather's~> ~<pledge~>: Othin's eye (the sun?), which he gave to the water-spirit Mimir (or Mim) in exchange for the latter's wisdom. It appears here and in stanza 29 as a drinking-vessel, from which Mimir drinks the magic mead, and from which he pours water on the ash Yggdrasil. Othin's sacrifice of his eye in order to gain knowledge of his final doom is one of the series of disasters leading up to the destruction of the gods. There were several differing versions of the story of Othin's relations with Mimir; another one, quite incompatible with this, appears in stanza 47. In the manuscripts ~<I know~> and ~<I see~> appear as \"she knows\" and \"she sees\" (cf. note on 21).]",

The ~<Hauksbok~> version omits all of stanzas 28-34, stanza 27 being there followed by stanzas 40 and 41. ~<Regius~> indicates stanzas 28 and 29 as a single stanza. Bugge puts stanza 28 after stanza 22, as the second stanza of his reconstructed poem. The Volva here addresses Othin directly, intimating that, although he has not told her, she knows why he has come to her, and what he has already suffered in his search for knowledge regarding his doom. Her reiterated \"would you know yet more?\" seems to mean: \"I have proved my wisdom by telling of the past and of your own secrets; is it your will that I tell likewise of the fate in store for you?\" ~<The Old One~>: Othin.\n\n29. The first line, not in either manuscript, is a conjectural emendation based on Snorri's paraphrase. Bugge puts this stanza after stanza 20.\n\n30. This is apparently the transitional stanza, in which the Volva, rewarded by Othin for her knowledge of the past (stanzas 1-29), is induced to proceed with her real prophecy (stanzas 31-66). Some editors turn the stanza into the third person, making it a narrative link. Bugge, on the other hand, puts it]",

They are also called \"Wish-Maidens,\" as the fulfillers of Othin's wishes. The conception of the supernatural warrior-maiden was presumably brought to Scandinavia in very early times from the South-Germanic races, and later it was interwoven with the likewise South-Germanic tradition of the swan-maiden. A third complication developed when the originally quite human women of the hero-legends were endowed with the qualities of both Valkyries and swan-maidens, as in the cases of Brynhild (cf. ~<Gripisspo~>, introductory note), ~<Svava~> (cf. ~<Helgakvitha~> ~<Hjorvarthssonar~>, prose after stanza 5 and note) and Sigrun (cf. ~<Helgakvitha~> ~<Hundingsbana~> I, 17 and note). The list of names here given may be an interpolation; a quite different list is given in ~<Grimnismol~>, 36. ~<Ranks of the gods~>: some editors regard the word thus translated as a specific place name. ~<Herjan~> (\"Leader of Hosts\"): Othin. It is worth noting that the name ~<Hild~> (\"Warrior\") is the basis of Bryn-hild (\"Warrior in Mail Coat\").\n\n32. Baldr: The death of Baldr, the son of Othin and Frigg, was the first of the great disasters to the gods. The story is fully told by Snorri. Frigg had demanded of all created things, saving only the mistletoe, which she thought too weak to be worth troubling]",
					
					"Famous and fair | in the lofty fields, | Full grown in strength | the mistletoe stood.\n\n33. From the branch which seemed | so slender and fair | Came a harmful shaft | that Hoth should hurl; | But the brother of Baldr | was born ere long, | And one night old | fought Othin's son.\n\n34. His hands he washed not, | his hair he combed not, | Till he bore to the bale-blaze | Baldr's foe. | But in Fensalir | did Frigg weep sore | For Valhall's need: | would you know yet more?\n\n35. One did I see | in the wet woods bound, | A lover of ill, | and to Loki like;\n\n[about, an oath that they would not harm Baldr. Thus it came to he a sport for the gods to hurl weapons at Baldr, who, of course, was totally unharmed thereby. Loki, the trouble-maker, brought the mistletoe to Baldr's blind brother, Hoth, and guided his hand in hurling the twig. Baldr was slain, and grief came upon all the gods. Cf. ~<Baldrs~> ~<Draumar~>.\n\n33. The lines in this and the following stanza have been combined in various ways by editors, lacunae having been freely conjectured, but the manuscript version seems clear enough. ~<The~> ~<brother~> ~<of~> ~<Baldr~>: Vali, whom Othin begot expressly to avenge Baldr's death. The day after his birth he fought and slew Hoth.\n\n34. ~<Frigg~>: Othin's wife. Some scholars have regarded her as a solar myth, calling her the sun-goddess, and pointing out that her home in ~<Fensalir~> (\"the sea-halls\") symbolizes the daily setting of the sun beneath the ocean horizon.\n\n35. The translation here follows the ~<Regius~> version. The ~<Hauksbok~> has the same final two lines, but in place of the first]",
					
					"By his side does Sigyn | sit, nor is glad\nTo see her mate: | would you know yet more?\n\n36. From the east there pours | through poisoned vales\nWith swords and daggers | the river Slith.\n. . . . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . . . .\n\n37. Northward a hall | in Nithavellir\nOf gold there rose | for Sindri's race;\nAnd in Okolnir | another stood,\nWhere the giant Brimir | his beer-hall had.\n\n[pair has, \"I know that Vali | his brother gnawed, / With his bowels then | was Loki bound.\" Many editors have followed this version of the whole stanza or have included these two lines, often marking them as doubtful, with the four from ~<Regius~>. After the murder of Baldr, the gods took Loki and bound him to a rock with the bowels of his son Narfi, who had just been torn to pieces by Loki's other son, Vali. A serpent was fastened above Loki's head, and the venom fell upon his face. Loki's wife, ~<Sigyn~>, sat by him with a basin to catch the venom, but whenever the basin was full, and she went away to empty it, then the venom fell on Loki again, till the earth shook with his struggles. \"And there he lies bound till the end.\" Cf. ~<Lokasenna~>, concluding prose.\n\n36. Stanzas 36-39 describe the homes of the enemies of the gods: the giants (36), the dwarfs (37), and the dead in the land of the goddess Hel (38-39). The ~<Hauksbok~> version omits stanzas 36 and 37. ~<Regius~> unites 36 with 37, but most editors have assumed a lacuna. ~<Slith~> (\"the Fearful\"): a river in the giants' home. The \"swords and daggers\" may represent the icy cold.\n\n37. ~<Nithavellir~> (\"the Dark Fields\"): a home of the dwarfs. Perhaps the word should be \"Nithafjoll\" (\"the Dark Crags\"). ~<Sindri~>: the great worker in gold among the dwarfs. ~<Okolnir~>]",
					
					"38. A hall I saw, | far from the sun,\nOn Nastrond it stands, | and the doors face north,\nVenom drops | through the smoke-vent down,\nFor around the walls | do serpents wind.\n\n39. I saw there wading | through rivers wild\nTreacherous men | and murderers too,\nAnd workers of ill | with the wives of men;\nThere Nithhogg sucked | the blood of the slain,\nAnd the wolf tore men; | would you know yet more?\n\n[(\"the Not Cold\"): possibly a volcano. ~<Brimir~>: the giant (possibly Ymir) out of whose blood, according to stanza 9, the dwarfs were made; the name here appears to mean simply the leader of the dwarfs.\n\n38. Stanzas 38 and 39 follow stanza 43 in the ~<Hauksbok~> version. Snorri quotes stanzas 39, 39, 40 and 41, though not consecutively. ~<Nastrond~> (\"Corpse-Strand\"): the land of the dead, ruled by the goddess Hel. Here the wicked undergo tortures. ~<Smoke~> ~<vent~>: the phrase gives a picture of the Icelandic house, with its opening in the roof serving instead of a chimney.\n\n39. The stanza is almost certainly in corrupt form. The third line is presumably an interpolation, and is lacking in most of the late, paper manuscripts. Some editors, however, have called lines 1-3 the remains of a full. stanza, with the fourth line lacking, and lines 4-5 the remains of another. The stanza depicts the torments of the two worst classes of criminals known to Old Norse morality--oath-breakers and murderers. ~<Nithhogg~> (\"the Dread Biter\"): the dragon that lies beneath the ash Yggdrasil and gnaws at its roots, thus symbolizing the destructive elements in the universe; cf. ~<Grimnismol~>, 32, 35. ~<The wolf~>: presumably the wolf Fenrir, one of the children of Loki and the giantess Angrbotha (the others being Mithgarthsorm and the goddess Hel), who was chained by the gods with the marvelous chain Gleipnir, fashioned by a dwarf \"out of six things: the]",

The ~<Hauksbok~> version inserts after stanza 39 the refrain stanza (44), and puts stanzas 40 and 41 between 27 and 21. With this stanza begins the account of the final struggle itself. ~<The giantess~>: her name is nowhere stated, and the only other reference to Ironwood is in ~<Grimnismol~>, 39, in this same connection. The children of this giantess and the wolf Fenrir are the wolves Skoll and Hati, the first of whom steals the sun, the second the moon. Some scholars naturally see here an eclipse myth.\n\n41. In the third line many editors omit the comma after \"sun,\" and put one after \"soon,\" making the two lines run: \"Dark grows the sun | in summer soon, / Mighty storms--\" etc. Either phenomenon in summer would be sufficiently striking.\n\n42. In the ~<Hauksbok~> version stanzas 42 and 43 stand between stanzas 44 and 38. ~<Eggther~>: this giant, who seems to be the watchman of the giants, as Heimdall is that of the gods and Surt of the dwellers in the fire-world, is not mentioned elsewhere in]",

This is a refrain-stanza. In ~<Regius~> it appears in full only at this point, but is repeated in abbreviated form before stanzas 50 and 59. In the ~<Hauksbok~> version the full stanza comes first between stanzas 35 and 42, then, in abbreviated form, it occurs four times: before stanzas 45, 50, 55, and 59. In the ~<Hauksbok~> line 3 runs: \"Farther I see and more can say.\" ~<Garm~>: the dog who guards the gates of Hel's kingdom; cf. Baldrs Draumar, 2 ff., and ~<Grimnismol~>, 44. ~<Gniparhellir~> (\"the Cliff-Cave\"): the entrance to the world of the dead. ~<The~> ~<wolf~>: Fenrir; cf. stanza 39 and note.\n\n45. From this point on through stanza 57 the poem is quoted by Snorri, stanza 49 alone being omitted. There has been much discussion as to the status of stanza 45. Lines 4 and 5 look like an interpolation. After line 5 the ~<Hauksbok~> has a line running: \"The world resounds, the witch is flying.\" Editors have arranged these seven lines in various ways, with lacunae freely indicated. ~<Sisters'~> ~<sons~>: in all Germanic countries the relations between uncle and nephew were felt to be particularly close.]",

This stanza refers to the story that he was sent by the gods with Hönir as a hostage to the Wanes after their war (cf. stanza 21 and note), and that the Wanes cut off his head and returned it to the gods. Othin embalmed the head, and by magic gave it the power of speech, thus making Mimir's noted wisdom always available. of course this story does not fit with that underlying the references to Mimir in stanzas 27 and 29. ~<The~> ~<kinsman~> ~<of~> ~<Surt~>: the wolf]",

As quoted by Snorri the first line of this stanza runs: \"Fares Othin's son | to fight with the wolf.\" ~<Sigfather~> (\"Father of Victory\"): Othin. His son, Vithar, is the silent god, famed chiefly for his great shield, and his strength, which is little less than Thor's. He survives the destruction. ~<The~> ~<giant's~> ~<son~>: Fenrir.\n\n55.

Snorri, in quoting these two stanzas, omits 55, 2-4, and 56, 3, making a single stanza out of 55, I, and 56, 4, 2, I, in that order. Moreover, the ~<Hauksbok~> manuscript at this point is practically illegible. The lacuna (line 3) is, of course, purely conjectural, and all sorts of arrangements of the lines have been attempted by editors, ~<Hlothyn~>: another name for Jorth (\"Earth\"), Thor's mother; his father was Othin. ~<The snake~>: Mithgarthsorm; cf. stanza 5c and note. ~<Othin's~> ~<son~>: Thor. The fourth line in ~<Regius~> reads \"against the wolf,\" but if this line refers to Thor at all, and not to Vithar, the ~<Hauksbok~> reading, \"serpent,\" is correct.\n\n56. ~<The~> ~<warder~> ~<of~> ~<earth~>: Thor. ~<The~> ~<son~> ~<of~> ~<Fjorgyn~>: again]",

With this stanza ends the account of the destruction.\n\n58. Again the refrain-stanza (cf. stanza 44 and note), abbreviated in both manuscripts, as in the case of stanza 49. It is probably misplaced here.\n\n59. Here begins the description of the new world which is to rise out of the wreck of the old one. It is on this passage that a few critics have sought to base their argument that the poem is later than the introduction of Christianity (circa 1000), but this theory has never seemed convincing (cf. introductory note).\n\n60.

This stanza is quoted by Snorri. ~<Gimle~>: Snorri makes this the name of the hall itself, while here it appears to refer to a mountain on which the hall stands. It is the home of the happy, as opposed to another hall, not here mentioned, for the dead. Snorri's description of this second hall is based on ~<Voluspo~>, 38, which he quotes, and perhaps that stanza properly belongs after 64.\n\n65. This stanza is not found in ~<Regius~>, and is probably spurious. No lacuna is indicated in the ~<Hauksbok~> version, but late paper manuscripts add two lines, running:\n\n\t\t\"Rule he orders, | and rights he fixes,\n\t\tLaws he ordains | that ever shall live.\"\n\nThe name of this new ruler is nowhere given, and of course the suggestion of Christianity is unavoidable.

Presumably the stanza (barring the last half-line, which was probably intended as the conclusion of the poem) belongs somewhere in the description of the great struggle. ~<Nithhogg~>: the dragon at the roots of Yggdrasil; cf. stanza 39 and note. ~<Nithafjoll~> (\"the Dark Crags\"); nowhere else mentioned. ~<Must~> ~<I~>: the manuscripts have \"must she.\"]"

					"~<Hovamol~>\n\n~<The Ballad of the High One~>\n\n~<Introductory Note~>\n\nThis poem follows the ~<Voluspo~> in the ~<Codex~> ~<Regius~>, but is preserved in no other manuscript. The first stanza is quoted by Snorri, and two lines of stanza 84 appear in one of the sagas.\n\nIn its present shape it involves the critic of the text in more puzzles than any other of the Eddic poems. Without going in detail into the various theories, what happened seems to have been somewhat as follows. There existed from very early times a collection of proverbs and wise counsels, which were attributed to Othin just as the Biblical proverbs were to Solomon. This collection, which presumably was always elastic in extent, was known as \"The High One's Words,\" and forms the basis of the present poem. To it, however, were added other poems and fragments dealing with wisdom which seemed by their nature to imply that the speaker was Othin. Thus a catalogue of runes, or charms, was tacked on, and also a set of proverbs, differing essentially in form from those comprising the main collection. Here and there bits of verse more nearly narrative crept in; and of course the loose structure of the poem made it easy for any reciter to insert new stanzas almost at will. This curious miscellany is what we now have as the ~<Hovamol~>.\n\nFive separate elements are pretty clearly recognizable: (1) the ~<Hovamol~> proper (stanzas 1-80), a collection of proverbs and counsels for the conduct of life; (2) the ~<Loddfafnismol~> (stanzas 111-138), a collection somewhat similar to the first, but specific ally addressed to a certain Loddfafnir; (3) the ~<Ljothatal~> (stanzas 147-165), a collection of charms; (4) the love-story of Othin and Billing's daughter (stanzas 96-102), with an introductory dissertation on the faithlessness of women in general (stanzas 81-95), which probably crept into the poem first, and then pulled the story, as an apt illustration, after it; (5) the story of how Othin got the mead of poetry--the draught which gave him the gift of tongues--from the maiden Gunnloth (stanzas 103-110). There is also a brief passage (stanzas 139 146) telling how Othin won the runes, this passage being a natural introduction to the ~<Ljothatal~>, and doubtless brought into the poem for that reason.",
					
					"It is idle to discuss the authorship or date of such a series of accretions as this. Parts of it are doubtless among the oldest relics of ancient Germanic poetry; parts of it may have originated at a relatively late period. Probably, however, most of its component elements go pretty far back, although we have no way of telling how or when they first became associated.\n\nIt seems all but meaningless to talk about \"interpolations\" in a poem which has developed almost solely through the process of piecing together originally unrelated odds and ends. The notes, therefore, make only such suggestions as are needed to keep the main divisions of the poem distinct.\n\nFew gnomic collections in the world's literary history present sounder wisdom more tersely expressed than the Hovamol. Like the Book of Proverbs it occasionally rises to lofty heights of poetry. If it presents the worldly wisdom of a violent race, it also shows noble ideals of loyalty, truth, and unfaltering courage.\n\n1.

This stanza is quoted by Snorri, the second line being omitted in most of the ~<Prose~> ~<Edda~> manuscripts.\n\n2. Probably the first and second lines had originally nothing to do with the third and fourth, the last two not referring to host or guest, but to the general danger of backing one's views with the sword.]",

The two lines of stanza 73 not only appear out of place, but the verse form is unlike that of the surrounding stanzas. In 74, the second line is clearly interpolated, and line I has little enough connection with lines 3, 4 and 5. It looks as though some compiler (or copyist) had inserted here various odds and ends for which he could find no better place.\n\n75. The word \"gold\" in line 2 is more or less conjectural, the manuscript being obscure. The reading in line 4 is also doubtful.]",

This stanza is certainly in bad shape, and probably out of place here. Its reference to runes as magic signs suggests that it properly belongs in some list of charms like the ~<Ljothatal~> (stanzas 147-165). The stanza-form is so irregular as to show either that something has been lost or that there have been interpolations. The manuscript indicates no lacuna; Gering fills out the assumed gap as follows:\n\n\t\t\"Certain is that which is sought from runes,\n\t\tThe runes--,\" etc.\n]",

With this stanza the verse-form, as indicated in the translation, abruptly changes to Malahattr. What has happened seems to have been something like this. Stanza 80 introduces the idea of man's love for woman. Consequently some reciter or compiler (or possibly even a copyist) took occasion to insert at this point certain stanzas concerning the ways of women. Thus stanza 80 would account for the introduction of stanzas 81 and 82, which, in turn, apparently drew stanza 83 in with them. Stanza 84 suggests the fickleness of women, and is immediately followed--again with a change of verse-form--by a list of things equally untrustworthy (stanzas 85-90). Then, after a few more stanzas on love in the regular measure of the ~<Hovamol~> (stanza 91-9s), is introduced, by way of illustration, Othin's story of his]",

Some such process of growth, whatever its specific stages may have been, must be assumed to account for the curious chaos of the whole passage from stanza 81 to stanza 102.\n\n84. Lines 3 and 4 are quoted in the ~<Fostbræthrasaga~>.\n\n85. Stanzas 85-88 and go are in Fornyrthislag, and clearly come from a different source from the rest of the ~<Hovamol~>.\n\n87. The stanza is doubtless incomplete. Some editors add from a late paper manuscript two lines running: \"In a light, clear sky | or a laughing throng, / In the bowl of a dog | or a harlot's grief!\"]", -- had to condense verses in the footnotes into a single line

This stanza follows stanza 89 in the manuscript. Many editors have changed the order, for while stanza 89 is pretty clearly an interpolation wherever it stands, it seriously interferes with the sense if it breaks in between 87 and 88.]",

Of this person we know nothing beyond what is here told, but the story needs little comment.]",

					"98. \"Othin, again | at evening come,\nIf a woman thou wouldst win;\nEvil it were | if others than we\nShould know of such a sin.\"\n\n99.

Rask adds at the beginning of this stanza two lines from a late paper manuscript, running:\n\n\"Few are so good | that false they are never\nTo cheat the mind of a man.\"\n\nHe makes these two lines plus lines I and 2 a full stanza, and line 3, 4, 5, and 6 a second stanza.]",

The mouth of Rati | made room for my passage,\nAnd space in the stone he gnawed;\n\n[103. With this stanza the subject changes abruptly, and apparently the virtues of fair speech, mentioned in the last three lines, account for the introduction, from what source cannot be known, of the story of Othin and the mead of song (stanzas 104-110).\n\n104. The giant ~<Suttung~> (\"the old giant\") possessed the magic mead, a draught of which conferred the gift of poetry. Othin, desiring to obtain it, changed himself into a snake, bored his way through a mountain into Suttung's home, made love to the giant's daughter, Gunnloth, and by her connivance drank up all the mead. Then he flew away in the form of an eagle, leaving Gunnloth to her fate. While with Suttung he assumed the name of Bolverk (\"the Evil-Doer\").\n\n105. ~<Rati~> (\"the Traveller\"): the gimlet with which Othin bored through the mountain to reach Suttung's home.]",

					"Above and below | the giants' paths lay,\nSo rashly I risked my head.\n\n106. Gunnloth gave | on a golden stool\nA drink of the marvelous mead;\nA harsh reward | did I let her have\nFor her heroic heart,\nAnd her spirit troubled sore.\n\n107. The well-earned beauty | well I enjoyed,\nLittle the wise man lacks;\nSo Othrörir now | has up been brought\nTo the midst of the men of earth.\n\n108. Hardly, methinks, | would I home have come,\nAnd left the giants' land,\nHad not Gunnloth helped me, | the maiden good,\nWhose arms about me had been.\n\n109. The day that followed, | the frost-giants came,\nSome word of Hor to win,\n(And into the hall of Hor;)\n\n[106. Probably either the fourth or the fifth line is a spurious addition.\n\n107. ~<Othrörir~>: here the name of the magic mead itself, whereas in stanza 141 it is the name of the vessel containing it. Othin had no intention of bestowing any of the precious mead upon men, but as he was flying over the earth, hotly pursued by Suttung, he spilled some of it out of his mouth, and in this way mankind also won the gift of poetry.\n\n108. ~<Hor~>: Othin (\"the High One\"). The frost-giants, Suttung's kinsmen, appear not to have suspected Othin of being]",

					"Of Bolverk they asked, | were he back midst the gods,\nOr had Suttung slain him there?\n\n110. On his ring swore Othin | the oath, methinks;\nWho now his troth shall trust?\nSuttung's betrayal | he sought with drink,\nAnd Gunnloth to grief he left.\n\n~<* * *~>\n\n111. It is time to chant | from the chanter's stool;\nBy the wells of Urth I was,\nI saw and was silent, | I saw and thought,\nAnd heard the speech of Hor.\n(Of runes heard I words, | nor were counsels wanting,\nAt the hall of Hor,\nIn the hall of Hor;\nSuch was the speech I heard.)\n\n[identical with Bolverk, possibly because the oath referred to in stanza I to was an oath made by Othin to Suttung that there was no such person as Bolverk among the gods. The giants, of course, fail to get from Othin the information they seek concerning Bolverk, but Othin is keenly conscious of having violated the most sacred of oaths, that sworn on his ring.\n\n111. With this stanza begins the Loddfafnismol (stanzas 111-138). Loddfafnir is apparently a wandering singer, who, from his \"chanter's stool,\" recites the verses which he claims to have received from Othin. ~<Wells of Urth~>: cf. ~<Voluspo~>, 19 and note. Urth (\"the Past\") is one of the three Norns. This stanza is apparently in corrupt form, and editors have tried many experiments with it, both in rejecting lines as spurious and in rearranging the words and punctuation. It looks rather as though the first four lines formed a complete stanza, and the last four had crept in later. The phrase translated \"the speech of Hor\" is \"Hova mol,\" later used as the title for the entire poem.]",

Lines 1-3 are the formula, repeated (abbreviated in the manuscript) in most of the stanzas, with which Othin prefaces his counsels to Loddfafnir, and throughout this section, except in stanzas 111 and 138, Loddfafnir represents himself as simply quoting Othin's words. The material is closely analogous to that contained in the first eighty stanzas of the poem. In some cases (e. g., stanzas 117, 119, 121, 126 and 130) the formula precedes a full four-line stanza instead of two (or three) lines.]",

This stanza suggests the dangers of too much hospitality. The beam (bolt) which is ever being raised to admit guests be comes weak thereby. It needs a ring to help it in keeping the door closed, and without the ability at times to ward off guests a man becomes the victim of his own generosity.\n\n137. The list of \"household remedies\" in this stanza is doubtless interpolated. Their nature needs no comment here.]",

In the manuscript this stanza comes at the end of the entire poem, following stanza 165. Most recent editors have followed Müllenhoff in shifting it to this position, as it appears to conclude the passage introduced by the somewhat similar stanza 111.\n\n139. With this stanza begins the most confusing part of the ~<Hovamol~>: the group of eight stanzas leading up to the Ljothatal, or list of charms. Certain paper manuscripts have before this stanza a title: \"Othin's Tale of the Runes.\" Apparently stanzas 139, 140 and 142 are fragments of an account of how Othin obtained the runes; 141 is erroneously inserted from some version of the magic mead story (cf. stanzas 104-110); and stanzas 143, 144, 145, and 146 are from miscellaneous sources, all, however, dealing with the general subject of runes. With stanza 147 a clearly continuous passage begins once more. ~<The windy tree~>: the ash Yggdrasil (literally \"the Horse of Othin,\" so called be cause of this story), on which Othin, in order to win the magic runes, hanged himself as an offering to himself, and wounded himself with his own spear. Lines 5 and 6 have presumably been borrowed from ~<Svipdagsmol~>, 30.]",

					"140. None made me happy | with loaf or horn,\nAnd there below I looked;\nI took up the runes, | shrieking I took them,\nAnd forthwith back I fell.\n\n141. Nine mighty songs | I got from the son\nOf Bolthorn, Bestla's father;\nAnd a drink I got | of the goodly mead\nPoured out from Othrörir.\n\n142. Then began I to thrive, | and wisdom to get,\nI grew and well I was;\nEach word led me on | to another word,\nEach deed to another deed.\n\n143. Runes shalt thou find, | and fateful signs,\nThat the king of singers colored,\nAnd the mighty gods have made;\n\n[141. This stanza, interrupting as it does the account of Othin's winning the runes, appears to be an interpolation. The meaning of the stanza is most obscure. Bolthorn was Othin's grandfather, and Bestla his mother. We do not know the name of the uncle here mentioned, but it has been suggested that this son of Bolthorn was Mimir (cf. ~<Voluspo~>, 27 and note, and 47 and note). In any case, the nine magic songs which he learned from his uncle seem to have enabled him to win the magic mead (cf. stanzas 104-110). Concerning ~<Othrörir~>, here used as the name of the vessel containing the mead, cf. stanza 107 and note.\n\n143. This and the following stanza belong together, and in many editions appear as a single stanza. They presumably come from some lost poem on the authorship of the runes. Lines 2 and 3 follow line 4 in the manuscript; the transposition was suggested by Bugge. ~<The~> ~<king~> ~<of~> ~<singers~>: Othin. The magic signs (runes) were commonly carved in wood, then colored red.]",

					"Full strong the signs, | full mighty the signs\nThat the ruler of gods doth write.\n\n144. Othin for the gods, | Dain for the elves,\nAnd Dvalin for the dwarfs,\nAlsvith for giants | and all mankind,\nAnd some myself I wrote.\n\n145. Knowest how one shall write, | knowest how one shall rede?\nKnowest how one shall tint, | knowest how one makes trial?\nKnowest how one shall ask, | knowest how one shall offer?\nKnowest how one shall send, | knowest how one shall sacrifice?\n\n[144. ~<Dain~> and ~<Dvalin~>: dwarfs; cf. ~<Voluspo~>, 14, and note. Dain, however, may here be one of the elves rather than the dwarf of that name. The two names also appear together in ~<Grimnismol~>, 33, where they are applied to two of the four harts that nibble at the topmost twigs of Yggdrasil. ~<Alsvith~> (\"the All Wise\") appears nowhere else as a giant's name. ~<Myself~>: Othin. We have no further information concerning the list of those who wrote the runes for the various races, and these four lines seem like a confusion of names in the rather hazy mind of some reciter.\n\n145. This Malahattr stanza appears to be a regular religious formula, concerned less with the runes which one \"writes\" and \"tints\" (cf. stanza 79) than with the prayers which one \"asks\" and the sacrifices which one \"offers\" and \"sends.\" Its origin is wholly uncertain, but it is clearly an interpolation here. In the manuscript the phrase \"knowest?\" is abbreviated after the first line.]",

This stanza as translated here follows the manuscript reading, except in assuming a gap between lines 3 and 5. In Vigfusson and Powell's ~<Corpus~> ~<Poeticum~> ~<Boreale~> the first three lines have somehow been expanded into eight. The last two lines are almost certainly misplaced; Bugge suggests that they belong at the end of stanza 144. ~<Thund~>: another name for Othin. ~<When~> ~<home~> ~<he~> ~<came~>: presumably after obtaining the runes as described in stanzas 139 and 140.\n\n147. With this stanza begins the ~<Ljothatal~>, or list of charms. The magic songs themselves are not given, but in each case the peculiar application of the charm is explained. The passage, which is certainly approximately complete as far as it goes, runs to the end of the poem. In the manuscript and in most editions line 4 falls into two half-lines, running:\n\n\"In sickness and pain | and every sorrow.\"\n]",

The sprinkling of a child with water was an established custom long before Christianity brought its conception of baptism.\n\n161. This stanza, according to Müllenhoff, was the original conclusion of the poem, the phrase \"a fifteenth\" being inserted only after stanzas 162-165 had crept in. ~<Delling~>: a seldom mentioned god who married Not (Night). Their son was Dag (Day). ~<Thjothrörir~>: not mentioned elsewhere. ~<Hroptatyr~>: Othin.]",

Some editors have combined these two lines with stanza 164. Others have assumed that the gap follows the first half-line, making \"so that-from me\" the end of the stanza.\n\n164. This stanza is almost certainly an interpolation, and seems to have been introduced after the list of charms and the ~<Loddfafnismol~> (stanzas 111-138) were combined in a single poem, for there is no other apparent excuse for the reference to Loddfafnir at this point. The words \"if thou mightest get them\" are a conjectural emendation.\n\n165. This stanza is almost totally obscure. The third and fourth lines look like interpolations.]"

					"~<Vafthruthnismol~>\n\n~<The Ballad of Vafthruthnir~>\n\n~<Introductory Note~>\n\nThe Vafthruthnismol follows the Hovamol in the ~<Codex~> ~<Regius~>. From stanza 20 on it is also included in the ~<Arnamagnæan~> ~<Codex~>, the first part evidently having appeared on leaf now lost. Snorri quotes eight stanzas of it in the ~<Prose~> ~<Edda~>, and in his prose text closely paraphrases many others.\n\nThe poem is wholly in dialogue form except for a single narrative stanza (stanza 5). After a brief introductory discussion between Othin and his wife, Frigg, concerning the reputed wisdom of the giant Vafthruthnir, Othin, always in quest of wisdom, seeks out the giant, calling himself Gagnrath. The giant immediately insists that they shall demonstrate which is the wiser of the two, and propounds four questions (stanzas 11, 13, 15, and 17), each of which Othin answers. It is then the god's turn to ask, and he begins with a series of twelve numbered questions regarding the origins and past history of life. These Vafthruthnir answers, and Othin asks five more questions, this time referring to what is to follow the destruction of the gods, the last one asking the name of his own slayer. Again Vafthruthnir answers, and Othin finally propounds the unanswerable question: \"What spake Othin himself in the ears of his son, ere in the bale-fire he burned?\" Vafthruthnir, recognizing his questioner as Othin himself, admits his inferiority in wisdom, and so the contest ends.\n\nThe whole poem is essentially encyclopædic in character, and thus was particularly useful to Snorri in his preparation of the ~<Prose~> ~<Edda~>. The encyclopædic poem with a slight narrative outline seems to have been exceedingly popular; the ~<Grimnismol~> and the much later ~<Alvissmol~> represent different phases of the same type. The ~<Vafthruthnismol~> and ~<Grimnismol~> together, in deed, constitute a fairly complete dictionary of Norse mythology. There has been much discussion as to the probable date of the ~<Vafthruthnismol~>, but it appears to belong to about the same period as the ~<Voluspo~>: in other words, the middle of the tenth century. While there may be a few interpolated passages in the poem as we now have it, it is clearly a united whole, and evidently in relatively good condition.",

Snorri gives, without materially elaborating on it, the same account of how Ymir's son and daughter were born under his left arm, and how his feet together created a son. That this offspring should have had six heads is nothing out of the ordinary, for various giants had more than the normal number, and Ymir's mother is credited with a little matter of nine hundred heads; cf. ~<Hymiskvitha~>, 8. Of the career of Ymir's six headed son we know nothing; he may have been the Thruthgelmir of stanza 29.]",

					"~<Grimnismol~>\n\n~<The Ballad of Grimnir~>\n\n~<Introductory Note~>\n\nThe ~<Grimnismol~> follows the ~<Vafthruthnismol~> in the ~<Codex~> ~<Regius~> and is also found complete in the ~<Arnamagnæan~> ~<Codex~>, where also it follows the ~<Vafthruthnismol~>. Snorri quotes over twenty of its stanzas.\n\nLike the preceding poem, the ~<Grimnismol~> is largely encyclopedic in nature, and consists chiefly of proper names, the last forty-seven stanzas containing no less than two hundred and twenty-five of these. It is not, however, in dialogue form. As Müllenhoff pointed out, there is underneath the catalogue of mythological names a consecutive and thoroughly dramatic story. Othin, concealed under the name of Grimnir, is through an error tortured by King Geirröth. Bound between two blazing fires, he begins to display his wisdom for the benefit of the king's little son, Agnar, who has been kind to him. Gradually he works up to the great final moment, when he declares his true name, or rather names, to the terrified Geirröth, and the latter falls on his sward and is killed.\n\nFor much of this story we do not have to depend on guesswork, for in both manuscripts the poem itself is preceded by a prose narrative of considerable length, and concluded by a brief prose statement of the manner of Geirröth's death. These prose notes, of which there are many in the Eddic manuscripts, are of considerable interest to the student of early literary forms. Presumably they were written by the compiler to whom we owe the Eddic collection, who felt that the poems needed such annotation in order to be clear. Linguistic evidence shows that they were written in the twelfth or thirteenth century, for they preserve none of the older word-forms which help us to date many of the poems two or three hundred years earlier.\n\nWithout discussing in detail the problems suggested by these prose passages, it is worth noting, first, that the Eddic poems contain relatively few stanzas of truly narrative verse; and second, that all of them are based on narratives which must have been more or less familiar to the hearers of the poems. In other words, the poems seldom aimed to tell stories, although most of them followed a narrative sequence of ideas. The stories",
					
					"themselves appear to have lived in oral prose tradition, just as in the case of the sagas; and the prose notes of the manuscripts, in so far as they contain material not simply drawn from the poems themselves, are relics of this tradition. The early Norse poets rarely conceived verse as a suitable means for direct story telling, and in some of the poems even the simplest action is told in prose \"links\" between dialogue stanzas.\n\nThe applications of this fact, which has been too often over looked, are almost limitless, for it suggests a still unwritten chapter in the history of ballad poetry and the so-called \"popular\" epic. It implies that narrative among early peoples may frequently have had a period of prose existence before it was made into verse, and thus puts, for example, a long series of transitional stages before such a poem as the ~<Iliad~>. In any case, the prose notes accompanying the Eddic poems prove that in addition to the poems themselves there existed in the twelfth century a considerable amount of narrative tradition, presumably in prose form, on which these notes were based by the compiler.\n\nInterpolations in such a poem as the ~<Grimnismol~> could have been made easily enough, and many stanzas have undoubtedly crept in from other poems, but the beginning and end of the poem are clearly marked, and presumably it has come down to us with the same essential outline it had when it was composed, probably in the first half of the tenth century.\n\nKing Hrauthung had two sons: one was called Agnar, and the other Geirröth. Agnar was ten winters old, and Geirröth eight. Once they both rowed in a boat with their fishing-gear to catch little fish; and the wind drove them out into the sea. In the darkness of the night they were wrecked on the shore; and going up, they found a poor peasant, with whom they stayed through the winter. The housewife took care of Agnar, and the peasant cared for\n\n[Prose. The texts of the two manuscripts differ in many minor details. ~<Hrauthung~>: this mythical king is not mentioned elsewhere. ~<Geirröth~>: the manuscripts spell his name in various ways]",
					
					"Geirröth, and taught him wisdom. In the spring the peasant gave him a boat; and when the couple led them to the shore, the peasant spoke secretly with Geirröth. They had a fair wind, and came to their father's landing-place. Geirröth was forward in the boat; he leaped up on land, but pushed out the boat and said, \"Go thou now where evil may have thee!\" The boat drifted out to sea. Geirröth, however, went up to the house, and was well received, but his father was dead. Then Geirröth was made king, and became a renowned man.\n\nOthin and Frigg sat in Hlithskjolf and looked over all the worlds. Othin said: \"Seest thou Agnar, thy fosterling, how he begets children with a giantess in the cave? But Geirröth, my fosterling, is a king, and now rules over his land.\" Frigg said: \"He is so miserly that he tortures his guests if he thinks that too many of them come to him.\" Othin replied that this was the greatest of lies; and they made a wager about this matter. Frigg sent her maid-servant, Fulla, to Geirröth. She bade the king beware lest a magician who was come thither to his land should bewitch him, and told this sign concerning him, that no dog was so fierce as to leap at him. Now it was a very great slander that King Geirröth was not hospitable; but nevertheless he had them take the man whom the dogs would not attack. He wore a dark-blue mantle and called himself Grimnir, but said no more about himself, though\n\n[~<Frigg~>: Othin's wife. She and Othin nearly always disagreed in some such way as the one outlined in this story. ~<Hlithskjolf~> (\"Gate-Shelf\"): Othin's watch-tower in heaven, whence he can overlook all the nine worlds; cf. ~<Skirnismol~>, introductory prose. ~<Grimnir~>: \"the Hooded One.\"]",
					
					"he was questioned. The king had him tortured to make him speak, and set him between two fires, and he sat there eight nights. King Geirröth had a son ten winters old, and called Agnar after his father's brother. Agnar went to Grimnir, and gave him a full horn to drink from, and said that the king did ill in letting him be tormented with out cause. Grimnir drank from the horn; the fire had come so near that the mantle burned on Grimnir's back. He spake:\n\n1. Hot art thou, fire! | too fierce by far;\nGet ye now gone, ye flames!\nThe mantle is burnt, | though I bear it aloft,\nAnd the fire scorches the fur.\n\n2. 'Twixt the fires now | eight nights have I sat,\nAnd no man brought meat to me,\nSave Agnar alone, | and alone shall rule\nGeirröth's son o'er the Goths.\n\n3. Hail to thee, Agnar! | for hailed thou art\nBy the voice of Veratyr;\n\n[2. In the original lines 2 and 4 are both too long for the meter, and thus the true form of the stanza is doubtful. For line 4 both manuscripts have \"the land of the Goths\" instead of simply \"the Goths.\" The word \"Goths\" apparently was applied indiscriminately to any South-Germanic people, including the Burgundians as well as the actual Goths, and thus here has no specific application; cf. ~<Gripisspo~>, 35 and note.]",

The god, or rather Wane, Njorth (cf. ~<Voluspo~>, 21, note) married Thjazi's daughter, Skathi. She wished to live in her father's hall among the mountains, while Njorth loved his home, Noatun, by the sea. They agreed to compromise by spending nine nights at Thrymheim and then three at Noatun, but neither could endure the surroundings of the other's home, so Skathi returned to Thrymheim, while Njorth stayed at Noatun.

Freyja, the sister of Freyr, is the fairest of the goddesses, and the most kindly disposed to mankind, especially to lovers. ~<Half~> ~<of~> ~<the~> ~<dead~>: Mogk has made it clear that Freyja represents a confusion between two originally distinct divinities: the wife of Othin (Frigg) and the northern goddess of love.

Snorri has this same confusion, but there is no reason why the Freyja who was Freyr's sister should share the slain with Othin.\n\n15. ~<Glitnir~> (\"the Shining\"): the home of Forseti, a god of whom we know nothing beyond what Snorri tells us: \"Forseti is the son of Baldr and Nanna, daughter of Nep. All those who come to him with hard cases to settle go away satisfied; he is the best judge among gods and men.\"\n\n16. ~<Noatun~> (\"Ships'-Haven\"): the home of Njorth, who calms the waves; cf. stanza 11 and ~<Voluspo~>, 21.\n\n17. ~<Vithi~>: this land is not mentioned elsewhere. ~<Vithar~> avenged his father, Othin, by slaying the wolf Fenrir.]",

Very possibly they are an interpolation here. ~<Eldhrimnir~> (\"Sooty with Fire\"): the great kettle in Valhall, wherein the gods' cook, ~<Andhrimnir~> (\"The Sooty-Faced\") daily cooks the flesh of the boar ~<Sæhrimnir~> (\"The Blackened\"). His flesh suffices for all the heroes there gathered, and each evening he becomes whole again, to be cooked the next morning.\n\n19. ~<Freki~> (\"The Greedy\") and ~<Geri~> (\"The Ravenous\"): the two wolves who sit by Othin's side at the feast, and to whom he gives all the food set before him, since wine is food and drink alike for him. ~<Heerfather~>: Othin. 20, ~<Mithgarth~> (\"The Middle Home\"): the earth. ~<Hugin~> (\"Thought\") and ~<Munin~> (\"Memory\"): the two ravens who sit on Othin's shoulders, and fly forth daily to bring him news of the world.]",

The last two lines refer to the attack on Valhall by the people of Hel; cf. Voluspo, 51.\n\n22. ~<Valgrind~> (\"The Death-Gate\"): the outer gate of Valhall; cf. ~<Sigurtharkvitha~> ~<en~> ~<skamma~>, 68 and note.\n\n23. This and the following stanza stand in reversed order in ~<Regius~>. Snorri quotes stanza 23 as a proof of the vast size of Valhall. The last two lines refer to the final battle with Fenrir and the other enemies.\n\n24. This stanza is almost certainly an interpolation, brought in through a confusion of the first two lines with those of stanza 23. Its description of Thor's house, Bilskirnir (cf. stanza 4 and]",

Snorri quotes the stanza in his account of Thor.\n\n25. The first line in the original is, as indicated in the translation, too long, and various attempts to amend it have been made. ~<Heithrun~>: the she-goat who lives on the twigs of the tree ~<Lærath~> (presumably the ash Yggdrasil), and daily gives mead which, like the boar's flesh, suffices for all the heroes in Valhall. In Snorri's ~<Edda~> Gangleri foolishly asks whether the heroes drink water, whereto Har replies, \"Do you imagine that Othin invites kings and earls and other noble men, and then gives them water to drink?\"\n\n26. Eikthyrnir (\"The Oak-Thorned,\" i.e., with antlers, \"thorns,\" like an oak): this animal presumably represents the clouds. The first line, like that of stanza 25, is too long in the original. ~<Lærath~>: cf. stanza 25, note. ~<Hvergelmir~>: according to Snorri, this spring, \"the Cauldron-Roaring,\" was in the midst of Niflheim, the world of darkness and the dead, beneath the third root of the ash Yggdrasil. Snorri gives a list of the rivers flowing thence nearly identical with the one in the poem.]",

The entire passage from stanza 27 through stanza 35 is confused. The whole thing may well be an interpolation. Bugge calls stanzas 27-30 an interpolation, and editors who have accepted the passage as a whole have rejected various lines. The spelling of the names of the rivers varies greatly in the manuscripts and editions. It is needless here to point out the many attempted emendations of this list. For a passage presenting similar problems, cf. ~<Voluspo~>, 10-16. Snorri virtually quotes stanzas 27-29 in his prose, though not consecutively. The name ~<Rin~>, in line 3, is identical with that for the River Rhine which appears frequently in the hero poems, but the similarity is doubt less purely accidental.\n\n28. ~<Slith~> may possibly be the same river as that mentioned in Voluspo, 36, as flowing through the giants' land. ~<Leipt~>: in ~<Helgakvitha~> ~<Hundingsbana~> ~<II~>, 29, this river is mentioned as one by which a solemn oath is sworn, and Gering points the parallel to the significance of the Styx among the Greeks. The other rivers here named are not mentioned elsewhere in the poems.]",

Kormt and Ormt | and the Kerlaugs twain\nShall Thor each day wade through,\n(When dooms to give | he forth shall go\nTo the ash-tree Yggdrasil;)\nFor heaven's bridge | burns all in flame,\nAnd the sacred waters seethe.\n\n30. Glath and Gyllir, | Gler and Skeithbrimir,\nSilfrintopp and Sinir,\nGisl and Falhofnir, | Golltopp and Lettfeti,\nOn these steeds the gods shall go\nWhen dooms to give | each day they ride\nTo the ash-tree Yggdrasil.\n\n[29. This stanza looks as though it originally had had nothing to do with the two preceding it. Snorri quotes it in his description of the three roots of Yggdrasil, and the three springs be neath them. \"The third root of the ash stands in heaven and beneath this root is a spring which is very holy, and is called Urth's well.\" (Cf. ~<Voluspo~>, 19) \"There the gods have their judgment-seat, and thither they ride each day over Bifrost, which is also called the Gods' Bridge.\" Thor has to go on foot in the last days of the destruction, when the bridge is burning. Another interpretation, however, is that when Thor leaves the heavens (i.e., when a thunder-storm is over) the rainbow-bridge becomes hot in the sun. Nothing more is known of the rivers named in this stanza. Lines 3-4 are almost certainly interpolated from stanza 30.\n\n30. This stanza, again possibly an interpolation, is closely paraphrased by Snorri following the passage quoted in the previous note. ~<Glath~> (\"Joyous\"): identified in the ~<Skaldskaparmal~> with Skinfaxi, the horse of day; cf. ~<Vafthruthnismol~>, 12. ~<Gyllir~>: \"Golden.\" ~<Gler~>: \"Shining.\" ~<Skeithbrimir~>: \"Swift-Going.\" ~<Silfrintopp~>: \"Silver-Topped.\" Sinir: \"Sinewy.\" ~<Gisl~>: the meaning is doubtful; Gering suggests \"Gleaming.\" ~<Falhofnir~>:]",
					
					"31. Three roots there are | that three ways run\n'Neath the ash-tree Yggdrasil;\n'Neath the first lives Hel, | 'neath the second the frost-giants,\n'Neath the last are the lands of men.\n\n32. Ratatosk is the squirrel | who there shall run\nOn the ash-tree Yggdrasil;\nFrom above the words | of the eagle he bears,\nAnd tells them to Nithhogg beneath.\n\n33. Four harts there are, | that the highest twigs\n\n[\"Hollow-Hoofed.\" ~<Golltopp~> (\"Gold-Topped\"): this horse be longed to Heimdall (cf. Voluspo, i and 46). It is noteworthy that gold was one of the attributes of Heimdall's belongings, and, because his teeth were of gold, he was also called Gullintanni (\"Gold-Toothed\"). ~<Lettfeti~>: \"Light-Feet.\" Othin's eight footed horse, ~<Sleipnir~>, is not mentioned in this list.\n\n31. The first of these roots is the one referred to in stanza 26; the second in stanza 29 (cf. notes). Of the third root there is nothing noteworthy recorded. After this stanza it is more than possible that one has been lost, paraphrased in the prose of Snorri's Edda thus: \"An eagle sits in the branches of the ash tree, and he is very wise; and between his eyes sits the hawk who is called Vethrfolnir.\"\n\n32. ~<Ratatosk~> (\"The Swift-Tusked\"): concerning this squirrel, the Prose Edda has to add only that he runs up and down the tree conveying the abusive language of the eagle (see note on stanza 31) and the dragon ~<Nithhogg~> (cf. ~<Voluspo~>, 39 and note) to each other. The hypothesis that Ratatosk \"represents the undying hatred between the sustaining and the destroying elements-the gods and the giants,\" seems a trifle far-fetched.\n\n33. Stanzas 33-34 may well be interpolated, and are certainly in bad shape in the Mss. Bugge points out that they are probably of later origin than those surrounding them. Snorri]",

Yggdrasil's ash | great evil suffers,\nFar more than men do know;\n\n[closely paraphrases stanza 33, but without elaboration, and nothing further is known of the ~<four~> ~<harts~>. It may be guessed, however, that they are a late multiplication of the single hart mentioned in stanza 26, just as the list of dragons in stanza 34 seems to have been expanded out of Nithhogg, the only authentic dragon under the root of the ash. ~<Highest~> ~<twigs~>: a guess; the Mss. words are baffling. Something has apparently been lost from lines 3-4, but there is no clue as to its nature.\n\n34. Cf. note on previous stanza. Nothing further is known of any of the serpents here listed, and the meanings of many of the names are conjectural. Snorri quotes this stanza. Editors have altered it in various ways in an attempt to regularize the meter. ~<Goin~> and ~<Moin~>: meaning obscure. ~<Grafvitnir~>: \"The Gnawing Wolf.\" ~<Grabak~>: \"Gray-Back.\" ~<Grafvolluth~>: \"The Field Gnawer.\" ~<Ofnir~> and ~<Svafnir~> (\"The Bewilderer\" and \"The Sleep-Bringer\"): it is noteworthy that in stanza 54 Othin gives himself these two names.\n\n35. Snorri quotes this stanza, which concludes the passage, beginning with stanza 25, describing Yggdrasil. If we assume that stanzas 27-34 are later interpolations--possibly excepting 32--this section of the poem reads clearly enough.]",
					
					"The hart bites its top, | its trunk is rotting,\nAnd Nithhogg gnaws beneath.\n\n36.

Arvak and Alsvith | up shall drag\nWeary the weight of the sun;\nBut an iron cool | have the kindly gods\nOf yore set under their yokes.\n\n[36. Snorri quotes this list of the Valkyries, concerning whom cf. Voluspo, 31 and note, where a different list of names is given. ~<Hrist~>: \"Shaker.\" ~<Mist~>: \"Mist.\" ~<Skeggjold~>: \"Ax-Time.\" ~<Skogul~>: \"Raging\" (?). ~<Hild~>: \"Warrior.\" ~<Thruth~>: \"Might.\" ~<Hlok~>: \"Shrieking.\" ~<Herfjotur~>: \"Host-Fetter.\" ~<Gol~>: \"Screaming.\" ~<Geironul~>: \"Spear-Bearer.\" ~<Randgrith~>: \"Shield-Bearer.\" ~<Rathgrith~>: Gering guesses \"Plan-Destroyer.\" ~<Reginleif~>: \"Gods'-Kin.\" Manuscripts and editions vary greatly in the spelling of these names, and hence in their significance.\n\n37. Müllenhoff suspects stanzas 37-41 to have been interpolated, and Edzardi thinks they may have come from the ~<Vafthruthnismol~>. Snorri closely paraphrases stanzas 37-39, and quotes 40-41. ~<Arvak~> (\"Early Waker\") and ~<Alsvith~> (\"All Swift\"): the horses of the sun, named also in ~<Sigrdrifumol~>, 15. According to Snorri: \"There was a man called Mundilfari, who had two children; they were so fair and lovely that he called his son Mani and his daughter Sol. The gods were angry at this presumption, and took the children and set them up in heaven; and they bade Sol drive the horses that drew the car of the sun]",
					
					"38. In front of the sun | does Svalin stand,\nThe shield for the shining god;\nMountains and sea | would be set in flames\nIf it fell from before the sun.\n\n39.

Out of Ymir's flesh | was fashioned the earth,\nAnd the ocean out of his blood;\nOf his bones the hills, | of his hair the trees,\nOf his skull the heavens high.\n\n[which the gods had made to light the world from the sparks which flew out of Muspellsheim. The horses were called Alsvith and Arvak, and under their yokes the gods set two bellows to cool them, and in some songs these are called 'the cold iron.'\"\n\n38. ~<Svalin~> (\"The Cooling\"): the only other reference to this shield is in ~<Sigrdrifumol~>, 15.\n\n39. ~<Skoll~> and ~<Hati~>: the wolves that devour respectively the sun and moon. The latter is the son of Hrothvitnir (\"The Mighty Wolf,\" i. e. Fenrir); cf. ~<Voluspo~>, 40, and ~<Vafthruthnismol~>, 46-47, in which Fenrir appears as the thief. ~<Ironwood~>: a conjectural emendation of an obscure phrase; cf. ~<Voluspo~>, 40.\n\n40. This and the following stanza are quoted by Snorri. They seem to have come from a different source from the others of this poem; Edzardi suggests an older version of the ~<Vafthruthnismol~>. This stanza is closely parallel to ~<Vafthruthnismol~>, 21, which see, as also ~<Voluspo~>, 3. Snorri, following this account, has a few details to add. The stones were made out of Ymir's teeth and such of his bones as were broken. Mithgarth was a mountain-wall made out of Ymir's eyebrows, and set around the earth because of the enmity of the giants.]",
					
					"41. Mithgarth the gods | from his eyebrows made,\nAnd set for the sons of men;\nAnd out of his brain | the baleful clouds\nThey made to move on high.\n\n42. His the favor of Ull | and of all the gods\nWho first in the flames will reach;\nFor the house can be seen | by the sons of the gods\nIf the kettle aside were cast.\n\n43. In days of old | did Ivaldi's sons\nSkithblathnir fashion fair,\n\The best of ships | for the bright god Freyr,\nThe noble son of Njorth.\n\n[42. With this stanza Othin gets back to his immediate situation, bound as he is between two fires. He calls down a blessing on the man who will reach into the fire and pull aside the great kettle which, in Icelandic houses, hung directly under the smoke vent in the roof, and thus kept any one above from looking down into the interior. On ~<Ull~>, the archer-god, cf. stanza 5 and note. He is specified here apparently for no better reason than that his name fits the initial-rhyme.\n\n43. This and the following stanza are certainly interpolated, for they have nothing to do with the context, and stanza 45 continues the dramatic conclusion of the poem begun in stanza 42. This stanza is quoted by Snorri. ~<Ivaldi~> (\"The Mighty\"): he is known only as the father of the craftsmen-dwarfs who made not only the ship Skithblathnir, but also Othin's spear Gungnir, and the golden hair for Thor's wife, Sif, after Loki had maliciously cut her own hair off. ~<Skithblathnir~>: this ship (\"Wooden-Bladed\") always had a fair wind, whenever the sail was set; it could be folded up at will and put in the pocket. ~<Freyr~>: concerning him and his father, see Voluspo, 21, note, and ~<Skirnismol~>, introductory prose and note.]",
					
					"44. The best of trees | must Yggdrasil be,\nSkithblathnir best of boats;\nOf all the gods | is Othin the greatest,\nAnd Sleipnir the best of steeds;\nBifrost of bridges, | Bragi of skalds,\nHobrok of hawks, | and Garm of hounds.\n\n45. To the race of the gods | my face have I raised,\nAnd the wished-for aid have I waked;\nFor to all the gods | has the message gone\nThat sit in Ægir's seats,\nThat drink within Ægir's doors.\n\n[44. Snorri quotes this stanza. Like stanza 43 an almost certain interpolation, it was probably drawn in by the reference to Skithblathnir in the stanza interpolated earlier. It is presumably in faulty condition. One Ms. has after the fifth line half of a sixth,--\"Brimir of swords.\" ~<Yggdrasil~>: cf. stanzas 25-35. ~<Skithblathnir~>: cf. stanza 43, note. ~<Sleipnir~>: Othin's eight-legged horse, one of Loki's numerous progeny, borne by him to the stallion Svathilfari. This stallion belonged to the giant who built a fortress for the gods, and came so near to finishing it, with Svathilfari's aid, as to make the gods fear he would win his promised reward--Freyja and the sun and moon. To delay the work, Loki turned himself into a mare, whereupon the stallion ran away, and the giant failed to complete his task within the stipulated time. ~<Bilrost~>: probably another form of Bifrost (which Snorri has in his version of the stanza), on which cf. stanza 29. ~<Bragi~>: the god of poetry. He is one of the later figures among the gods, and is mentioned only three times in the poems of the ~<Edda~>. In Snorri's ~<Edda~>, however, he is of great importance. His wife is Ithun, goddess of youth. Perhaps the Norwegian skald Bragi Boddason, the oldest recorded skaldic poet, had been traditionally apotheosized as early as the tenth century. ~<Hobrok~>: nothing further is known of him. ~<Garm~>: cf. Voluspo, 44.\n\n45. With this stanza the narrative current of the poem is resumed. Ægir: the sea-god; cf. ~<Lokasenna~>, introductory prose.]",

Concerning the condition of stanzas 46-50, quoted by Snorri, nothing definite can be said. Lines and entire stanzas of this \"catalogue\" sort undoubtedly came and went with great freedom all through the period of oral transmission. Many of the names are not mentioned elsewhere, and often their significance is sheer guesswork. As in nearly every episode Othin appeared in disguise, the number of his names was necessarily almost limitless. ~<Grim~>: \"The Hooded.\" ~<Gangleri~>: \"The Wanderer.\" ~<Herjan~>: \"The Ruler.\" ~<Hjalmberi~>: \"The Helmet-Bearer.\" ~<Thekk~>: \"The Much-Loved.\" ~<Thrithi~>: \"The Third\" (in Snorri's Edda the stories are all told in the form of answers to questions, the speakers being Har, Jafnhar and Thrithi. Just what this tripartite form of Othin signifies has been the source of endless debate. Probably this line is late enough to betray the somewhat muddled influence of early Christianity.) ~<Thuth~> and ~<Uth~>: both names defy guesswork. ~<Helblindi~>: \"Hel-Blinder\" (two manuscripts have ~<Herblindi~>--\"Host-Blinder\"). ~<Hor~>: \"The High One.\"\n\n47. ~<Sath~>: \"The Truthful.\" ~<Svipal~>: \"The Changing.\" ~<Sanngetal~>: \"The Truth-Teller.\" ~<Herteit~>: \"Glad of the Host.\" ~<Hnikar~>: \"The Overthrower.\" ~<Bileyg~>: \"The Shifty-Eyed.\" ~<Baleyg~>: \"The Flaming-Eyed.\" ~<Bolverk~>: \"Doer of Ill\" (cf.

Nothing is known of Asmund, of Othin's appearance as Jalk, or of the occasion when he \"went in a sledge\" as Kjalar (\"Ruler of Keels\"?). ~<Thror~> and ~<Vithur~> are also of uncertain meaning. ~<Oski~>: \"God of Wishes.\" ~<Biflindi~>: the manuscripts vary widely in the form of this name. ~<Jafnhor~>: \"Equally High\" (cf. note on stanza 46). ~<Omi~>: \"The Shouter.\" ~<Gondlir~>: \"Wand Bearer.\" ~<Harbarth~>: \"Graybeard\" (cf. ~<Harbarthsljoth~>, introduction).\n\n50. Nothing further is known of the episode here mentioned Sokkmimir is presumably Mithvitnir's son. Snorri quotes the names Svithur and Svithrir, but omits all the remainder of the stanza.]",

					"King Geirröth sat and had his sword on his knee, half drawn from its sheath. But when he heard that Othin was come thither, then he rose up and sought to take Othin from the fire. The sword slipped from his hand, and fell with the hilt down. The king stumbled and fell forward, and the sword pierced him through, and slew him. Then Othin vanished, but Agnar long ruled there as king."

Snorri quotes the concluding stanza. In ~<Regius~> the poem is entitled \"For Scirnis\" (\"Skirnir's journey\").\n\nThe ~<Skirnismol~> differs sharply from the poems preceding it, in that it has a distinctly ballad quality. As a matter of fact, however, its verse is altogether dialogue, the narrative being supplied in the prose \"links,\" concerning which cf. introductory note to the ~<Grimnismol~>. The dramatic effectiveness and vivid characterization of the poem seem to connect it with the ~<Thrymskvitha~>, and the two may possibly have been put into their present form by the same man. Bugge's guess that the Skirnismol was the work of the author of the ~<Lokasenna~> is also possible, though it has less to support it.\n\nCritics have generally agreed in dating the poem as we now have it as early as the first half of the tenth century; Finnur Jonsson puts it as early as goo, and claims it, as usual, for Norway. Doubtless it was current in Norway, in one form or another, before the first Icelandic settlements, but his argument that the thistle (stanza 31) is not an Icelandic plant has little weight, for such curse-formulas must have traveled freely from place to place. In view of the evidence pointing to a western origin for many or all of the Eddic poems, Jonsson's reiterated \"Digtet er sikkert norsk og ikke islandsk\" is somewhat exasperating.

Freyr is the noblest of the gods; he rules over rain and sunshine, and therewith the fruitfulness of the earth; it is well to call upon him for plenty and welfare, for he rules over wealth for mankind. Freyja is the noblest of the goddesses. When she rides to the fight, she has one-half of the slain, and Othin has half. When she goes on a journey, she drives her two cats, and sits in a cart. Love-songs please her well, and it is good to call on her in love-matters.\" ~<Hlithskjolf~>: Othin's watch-tower; cf. ~<Grimnismol~>, introductory prose. ~<He~> ~<said~>: both manuscripts have \"Then Skathi said:\" (Skathi was Njorth's wife), but Bugge's emendation, based on Snorri's version, is doubtless correct.\n\n1. ~<My~> ~<son~>: both manuscripts, and many editors, have \"our son,\" which, of course, goes with the introduction of Skathi in the prose.

Three nouns of doubtful meaning, which I have rendered ~<rage~>, ~<longing~>, and ~<heart~> respectively, make the precise force of this stanza obscure. Niedner and Sijmons mark the entire stanza as interpolated, and Jonsson rejects line 5.\n\n30. In ~<Regius~> and in nearly all the editions the first two lines of this stanza are followed by lines 3-5 of stanza 35. I have followed Niedner, Sijmons, and Gering. The two words here translated ~<vile~> ~<things~> are obscure; Gering renders the phrase simply \"Kobolde.\"\n\n31. The confusion noted as to the preceding stanza, and a metrical error in the third line, have led to various rearrangements and emendations; line 3 certainly looks like an interpolation. ~<Three-headed~> ~<giants~>: concerning giants with numerous heads, cf. ~<Vafthruthnismol~>, 33, and ~<Hymiskvitha~>, 8.]",

No gap indicated in the manuscript; Niedner makes the line here given as 4 the first half of line 3, and fills out the stanza thus: \"with which I will tame you, / Maid, to work my will.\" The whole stanza seems to be either interpolated or out of place; it would fit better after stanza 25.\n\n33. Jonsson marks this stanza as interpolated. The word translated ~<most~> ~<evil~> is another case of guesswork.\n\n34. Most editors reject line 3 as spurious, and some also reject line 6. Lines 2 and 3 may have been expanded out of a single line running approximately \"Ye gods and Suttung's sons.\" ~<Suttung~>: concerning this giant cf. Hovamol, 104 and note.]",

The scribe clearly did not consider that the stanza began with line I, as the first word thereof in the manuscript does not begin with a capital letter and has no period before it. The first word of line 3, however, is so marked. Line 5 may well be spurious.\n\n37. Again the scribe seems to have been uncertain as to the stanza divisions. This time the first line is preceded by a period, but begins with a small letter. Many editors have made line 2]",

					"~<Harbarthsljoth~>\n\n~<The Poem of Harbarth~>\n\n~<Introductory Note~>\n\nThe Harbarthsljoth is found complete in the ~<Codex~> ~<Regius~>, where it follows the ~<Skirnismol~>, and from the fourth line of stan{z}a 19 to the end of the poem in the ~<Arnamagnæan~> ~<Codex~>, of which it occupies the first page and a half.\n\nThe poem differs sharply from those which precede it in the ~<Codex~> ~<Regius~>, both in metrical form and in spirit. It is, indeed, the most nearly formless of all the Eddic poems. The normal metre is the Malahattr (cf. Introduction, where an example is given). The name of this verse-form means \"in the manner of conversation,\" and the Harbarthsljoth's verse fully justifies the term. The Atli poems exemplify the conventional use of Malahattr, but in the Harbarthsljoth the form is used with extraordinary freedom, and other metrical forms are frequently employed. A few of the speeches of which the poem is composed cannot be twisted into any known Old Norse metre, and appear to be simply prose.\n\nHow far this confusion is due to interpolations and faulty transmission of the original poem is uncertain. Finnur Jonsson has attempted a wholesale purification of the poem, but his arbitrary condemnation of words, lines, and entire stanzas as spurious is quite unjustified by any positive evidence. I have accepted Mogk's theory that the author was \"a first-rate psychologist, but a poor poet,\" and have translated the poem as it stands in the manuscripts. I have preserved the metrical confusion of the original by keeping throughout so far as possible to the metres found in the poem; if the rhythm of the translation is often hard to catch, the difficulty is no less with the original Norse.\n\nThe poem is simply a contest of abuse, such as the early Norwegian and Icelander delighted in, the opposing figures being Thor and Othin, the latter appearing in the disguise of the ferryman Harbarth. Such billingsgate lent itself readily to changes, interpolations and omissions, and it is little wonder that the poem is chaotic. It consists mainly of boasting and of references, often luckily obscure, to disreputable events in the life of one or the other of the disputants. Some editors have sought to read a complex symbolism into it, particularly by representing",
					
					"it as a contest between the noble or warrior class (Othin) and the peasant (Thor). But it seems a pity to take such a vigorous piece of broad farce too seriously.\n\nVerse-form, substance, and certain linguistic peculiarities, notably the suffixed articles, point to a relatively late date (eleventh century) for the poem in its present form. Probably it had its origin in the early days, but its colloquial nature and its vulgarity made it readily susceptible to changes.\n\nOwing to the chaotic state of the text, and the fact that none of the editors or commentators have succeeded in improving it much, I have not in this case attempted to give all the important emendations and suggestions. The stanza-divisions are largely arbitrary.\n\n__________________\n\nThor was on his way back from a journey in the East, and came to a sound; on the other side of the sound was a ferryman with a boat. Thor called out:\n\n1. \"Who is the fellow yonder, | on the farther shore of the sound?\"\n\n[~<Prose~>. ~<Harbarth~> (\"Gray-Beard\"): Othin. On the nature of the prose notes found in the manuscripts, cf. ~<Grimnismol~>, introduction. ~<Thor~>: the journeys of the thunder-god were almost as numerous as those of Othin; cf. ~<Thrymskvitha~> and ~<Hymiskvitha~>. Like the Robin Hood of the British ballads, Thor was often temporarily worsted, but always managed to come out ahead in the end. His \"Journey in the East\" is presumably the famous episode, related in full by Snorri, in the course of which he en countered the giant Skrymir, and in the house of Utgartha-Loki lifted the cat which turned out to be Mithgarthsorm. The ~<Hymiskvitha~> relates a further incident of this journey.]",
					
					"~<The ferryman spake:~>\n2. \"What kind of a peasant is yon, | that calls o'er the bay?\"\n\n~<Thor spake:~>\n3. \"Ferry me over the sound; | I will feed thee therefor in the morning;\nA basket I have on my back, | and food therein, none better;\nAt leisure I ate, | ere the house I left,\nOf herrings and porridge, | so plenty I had.\"\n\n~<The ferryman spake:~>\n4. \"Of thy morning feats art thou proud, | but the future thou knowest not wholly;\nDoleful thine home-coming is: | thy mother, me thinks, is dead.\"\n\n~<Thor spake:~>\n5. \"Now hast thou said | what to each must seem\nThe mightiest grief, | that my mother is dead.\"\n\n[2. The superscriptions to the speeches are badly confused in the manuscripts, but editors have agreed fairly well as to where they belong. 3. From the fact that in ~<Regius~> line 3 begins with a capital letter, it is possible that lines 3-4 constitute the ferryman's reply, with something lost before stanza 4.\n\n4. ~<Thy~> ~<mother~>: Jorth (Earth).\n\n5.

After rescuing his father, Magni said to him: \"There would have been little trouble, father, had I but come sooner; I think I should have sent this giant to hell with my fist if I had met him first.\" Magni and his brother, Mothi, inherit Thor's hammer.\n\n12. This stanza is hopelessly confused as to form, but none of the editorial rearrangements have materially altered the meaning. ~<Doomed~> ~<to~> ~<die~>: the word \"feigr\" occurs constantly in the Old Norse poems and sagas; the idea of an inevitable but unknown fate seems to have been practically universal through out the pre-Christian period. On the concealment of names from enemies, cf. ~<Fafnismol~>, prose after stanza 1.]",

In the race, which Hrungnir lost, he managed to dash uninvited into the home of the gods, where he became very drunk. Thor ejected him, and accepted his challenge to a duel. Hrungnir, terrified, had a helper made for him in the form of a dummy giant nine miles high and three miles broad. Hrungnir himself had a three-horned heart of stone and a head of stone; his shield was of stone and his weapon was a grindstone. But Thjalfi, Thor's servant, told him the god would attack him out of the ground, wherefore Hrungnir laid down his shield and stood on it.

Thor is always eager for stories of this sort; cf. stanzas 31 and 33.\n\n19. Lines 1-2 are obscure, but apparently Harbarth means that the women were wise to give in to him cheerfully, resistance to his power being as impossible as (lines 3-4) making ropes of sand or digging the bottoms out of the valleys.

Loki, through whose fault she had been betrayed, was sent after her by the gods. He went in Freyja's \"hawk's-dress\" (cf. ~<Thrymskvitha~>, 3), turned Ithun into a nut, and flew back with her. Thjazi, in the shape of an eagle, gave chase. But the gods kindled a fire which burnt the eagle's wings, and then they killed him. Snorri's prose version does not attribute this feat particularly to Thor. Thjazi's daughter was Skathi, whom the gods permitted to marry Njorth as a recompense for her father's death. ~<Alvaldi~>: of him we know only that he was the father of Thjazi, Ithi and Gang, who divided his wealth, each taking a mouthful of gold.

Nowhere else is it indicated that Thor has an asylum for dead peasants.\n\n26. The reference here is to one of the most familiar episodes in Thor's eastward journey. He and his companions came to a house in the forest, and went in to spend the night. Being disturbed by an earthquake and a terrific noise, they all crawled into a smaller room opening from the main one. In the morning, however, they discovered that the earthquake had been occasioned by the giant Skrymir's lying down near them, and the noise by his snoring. The house in which they had taken refuge was his glove, the smaller room being the thumb. Skrymir was in fact Utgartha-Loki himself. That he is in this stanza called Fjalar (the name occurs also in ~<Hovamol~>, 14) is probably due to a confusion of the names by which Utgartha-Loki went. Loki taunts Thor with this adventure in ~<Lokasenna~>, 60 and 62, line 3 of this stanza being perhaps interpolated from ~<Lokasenna~>, 60, 4.]",

				Index = 10,
				Text = {
					"~<Hymiskvitha~>\n\n~<The Lay of Hymir~>\n\n~<Introductory Note~>\n\nThe ~<Hymiskvitha~> is found complete in both manuscripts; in ~<Regius~> it follows the ~<Harbarthsljoth~>, while in the ~<Arnamagnæan~> ~<Codex~> it comes after the ~<Grimnismol~>. Snorri does not quote it, although he tells the main story involved.\n\nThe poem is a distinctly inferior piece of work, obviously based on various narrative fragments, awkwardly pieced together. Some critics, Jessen and Edzardi for instance, have maintained that the compiler had before him three distinct poems, which he simply put together; others, like Finnur Jonsson and Mogk, think that the author made a new poem of his own on the basis of earlier poems, now lost. It seems probable that he took a lot of odds and ends of material concerning Thor, whether in prose or in verse, and worked them together in a perfunctory way, without much caring how well they fitted. His chief aim was probably to impress the credulous imaginations of hearers greedy for wonders.\n\nThe poem is almost certainly one of the latest of those dealing with the gods, though Finnur Jonsson, in order to support his theory of a Norwegian origin, has to date it relatively early. If, as seems probable, it was produced in Iceland, the chances are that it was composed in the first half of the eleventh century. Jessen, rather recklessly, goes so far as to put it two hundred years later. In any case, it belongs to a period of literary decadence,--the great days of Eddic poetry would never have permitted the nine hundred headed person found in Hymir's home-- and to one in which the usual forms of diction in mythological poetry had yielded somewhat to the verbal subtleties of skaldic verse.\n\nWhile the skaldic poetry properly falls outside the limits of this book, it is necessary here to say a word about it. There is preserved, in the sagas and elsewhere, a very considerable body of lyric poetry, the authorship of each poem being nearly always definitely stated, whether correctly or otherwise. This type of poetry is marked by an extraordinary complexity of diction, with a peculiarly difficult vocabulary of its own. It was to explain some of the \"kennings\" which composed this special",
					
					"vocabulary that Snorri wrote one of the sections of the ~<Prose~> ~<Edda~>. As an illustration, in a single stanza of one poem in the ~<Egilssaga~>, a sword is called \"the halo of the helm,\" \"the wound-hoe,\" \"the blood-snake\" (possibly; no one is sure what the compound word means) and \"the ice of the girdle,\" while men appear in the same stanza as \"Othin's ash-trees,\" and battle is spoken of as \"the iron game.\" One of the eight lines has defied translation completely.\n\nSkaldic diction made relatively few inroads into the earlier Eddic poems, but in the ~<Hymiskvitha~> these circumlocutions are fairly numerous. This sets the poem somewhat apart from the rest of the mythological collection. Only the vigor of the two main stories--Thor's expedition after Hymir's kettle and the fishing trip in which he caught Mithgarthsorm--saves it from complete mediocrity.\n\n1. Of old the gods | made feast together,\nAnd drink they sought | ere sated they were;\nTwigs they shook, | and blood they tried:\nRich fare in Ægir's | hall they found.\n\n[1. ~<Twigs~>: Vigfusson comments at some length on \"the rite practised in the heathen age of inquiring into the future by dipping bunches of chips or twigs into the blood (of sacrifices) and shaking them.\" But the two operations may have been separate, the twigs being simply \"divining-rods\" marked with runes. In either case, the gods were seeking information by magic as to where they could find plenty to drink. ~<Ægir~>: a giant who is also the god of the sea; little is known of him outside of what is told here and in the introductory prose to the ~<Lokasenna~>, though Snorri has a brief account of him, giving his home as Hlesey (Läsö, cf. ~<Harbarthsljoth~>, 37). ~<Grimnismol~>, 45, has a reference to this same feast.]",
					
					"2. The mountain-dweller | sat merry as boyhood,\nBut soon like a blinded | man he seemed;\nThe son of Ygg | gazed in his eyes:\n\"For the gods a feast | shalt thou forthwith get.\"\n\n3. The word-wielder toil | for the giant worked,\nAnd so revenge | on the gods he sought;\nHe bade Sif's mate | the kettle bring:\n\"Therein for ye all | much ale shall I brew.\"\n\n4. The far-famed ones | could find it not,\nAnd the holy gods | could get it nowhere;\nTill in truthful wise | did Tyr speak forth,\nAnd helpful counsel | to Hlorrithi gave.\n\n5. \"There dwells to the east | of Elivagar\nHymir the wise | at the end of heaven;\nA kettle my father | fierce doth own,\nA mighty vessel | a mile in depth.\"\n\n[2. ~<Mountain-dweller~>: the giant (Ægir). ~<Line 2~>: the principal word in the original has defied interpretation, and any translation of the line must be largely guesswork. ~<Ygg~>: Othin; his son is Thor. Some editors assume a gap after this stanza.\n\n3. ~<Word-wielder~>: Thor. ~<The giant~>: Ægir. ~<Sif~>: Thor's wife; cf. Harbarthsljoth, 48. ~<The~> ~<kettle~>: Ægir's kettle is possibly the sea itself.\n\n4. ~<Tyr~>: the god of battle; his two great achievements were thrusting his hand into the mouth of the wolf Fenrir so that the gods might bind him, whereby he lost his hand (cf. ~<Voluspo~>, 39, note), and his fight with the hound Garm in the last battle, in which they kill each other. ~<Hlorrithi~>: Thor.\n\n5. ~<Elivagar~> (\"Stormy Waves\"): possibly the Milky Way;]",

The youth found his grandam, | that greatly he loathed,\n\n[cf. ~<Vafthruthnismol~>, 31, note. ~<Hymir~>: this giant figures only in this episode. It is not clear why Tyr, who is elsewhere spoken of as a son of Othin, should here call Hymir his father. Finnur Jonsson, in an attempt to get round this difficulty, deliberately changed the word \"father\" to \"grandfather,\" but this does not help greatly.\n\n6. Neither manuscript has any superscriptions, but most editors have supplied them as above. From this point through stanza it the editors have varied considerably in grouping the lines into stanzas. The manuscripts indicate the third lines of stanzas 7, 8, 9, and to as beginning stanzas, but this makes more complications than the present arrangement. It is possible that, as Sijmons suggests, two lines have been lost after stanza 6.\n\n7. ~<Egil~>: possibly, though by no means certainly, the father of Thor's servant, Thjalfi, for, according to Snorri, Thor's first stop on this journey was at the house of a peasant whose children, Thjalfi and Roskva, he took into his service; cf. stanza 38, note. The ~<Arnamagnæan~> ~<Codex~> has \"Ægir\" instead of \"Egil,\" but, aside from the fact that Thor had just left Ægir's house, the sea-god can hardly have been spoken of as a goat-herd.\n\n8. ~<The~> ~<youth~>: Tyr, whose extraordinary grandmother is Hymir's mother. We know nothing further of her, or of the other,]",
					
					"And full nine hundred | heads she had;\nBut the other fair | with gold came forth,\nAnd the bright-browed one | brought beer to her son.\n\n9. \"Kinsman of giants, | beneath the kettle\nWill I set ye both, | ye heroes bold;\nFor many a time | my dear-loved mate\nTo guests is wrathful | and grim of mind.\"\n\n10.

It may be guessed, however, that she belonged rather to the race of the gods than to that of the giants.\n\n11. Two or three editors give this stanza a superscription (\"The concubine spake\", \"The daughter spake\"). Line 3 is commonly regarded as spurious. ~<The~> ~<foeman~> ~<of~> ~<Hroth~>: of course this means Thor, but nothing is known of any enemy of his by this name. Several editors have sought to make a single word meaning \"the famous enemy\" out of the phrase.

Hymir's wrath does not permit him to ignore the duties of a host to his guests, always strongly insisted on.\n\n15. Thor's appetite figures elsewhere; cf. ~<Thrymskvitha~>, 24.\n\n16. ~<The~> ~<comrade~> ~<of~> ~<Hrungnir~>: Hymir, presumably simply because both are giants; cf. ~<Harbarthsljoth~>, 14 and note.]",

Sijmons and Gering assume a gap after these two lines, but it seems more probable that the missing passage, if any, belonged before them, supplying the connection with the previous stanza.\n\n18. The manuscripts have no superscription. Many editors combine lines 3 and 4 with lines 1 and 2 of stanza 19. In Snorri's extended paraphrase of the story, Hymir declines to go fishing with Thor on the ground that the latter is too small a person to be worth bothering about. \"You would freeze,\" he says, \"if you stayed out in mid-ocean as long as I generally do.\" ~<Bait~> (line 4): the word literally means \"chaff,\" hence any small bits; Hymir means that Thor should collect dung for bait.\n\n19. Many editors combine lines 3 and 4 with stanza 20. ~<Fortress~>, etc.: the ox's head; cf. introductory note concerning the diction of this poem. Several editors assume a lacuna after stanza 19, but this seems unnecessary.]",

No gap is indicated in the manuscripts, but that a line or more has been lost is highly probable. In Snorri's version, Thor pulls so hard on the line that he drives both his feet through the flooring of the boat, and stands on bottom. When he pulls the serpent up, Hymir cuts the line with his bait-knife, which explains the serpent's escape. Thor, in a rage, knocks Hymir overboard with his hammer, and then wades ashore.

					"~<Lokasenna~>\n\n~<Loki's Wrangling~>\n\n~<Introductory Notes~>\n\nThe ~<Lokasenna~> is found only in ~<Regius~>, where it follows the ~<Hymiskvitha~>; Snorri quotes four lines of it, grouped together as a single stanza.\n\nThe poem is one of the most vigorous of the entire collection, and seems to have been preserved in exceptionally good condition. The exchange or contest of insults was dear to the Norse heart, and the ~<Lokasenna~> consists chiefly of Loki's taunt; to the assembled gods and goddesses, and their largely ineffectual attempts to talk back to him. The author was evidently well versed in mythological fore, and the poem is full of references to incidents not elsewhere recorded. As to its date and origin there is the usual dispute, but the latter part of the tenth century and Iceland seem the best guesses.\n\nThe prose notes are long and of unusual interest. The introductory one links the poem closely to the ~<Hymiskvitha~>, much as the ~<Reginsmol~>, ~<Fafnismol~> and ~<Sigrdrifumol~> are linked together; the others fill in the narrative gaps in the dialogue--very like stage directions,--and provide a conclusion by relating Loki's punishment, which, presumably, is here connected with the wrong incident. It is likely that often when the poem was recited during the two centuries or so before it was committed to writing, the speaker inserted some such explanatory comments, and the compiler of the collection followed this example by adding such explanations as he thought necessary. The ~<Lokasenna~> is certainly much older than the ~<Hymiskvitha~>, the connection between them being purely one of subject-matter; and the twelfth-century compiler evidently knew a good deal less about mythology than the author whose work he was annotating.\n\n__________________\n\nÆgir, who was also called Gymir, had prepared ale for the gods, after he had got the mighty kettle, as now has been told. To this feast came Othin and Frigg, his wife. Thor came not, as he was on a journey in the East. Sif,",
					
					"Thor's wife, was there, and Brag, with Ithun, his wife. Tyr, who had but one hand, was there; the wolf Fenrir had bitten off his other hand when they had bound him. There were Njorth and Skathi his wife, Freyr and Freyja, and Vithar, the son of Othin. Loki was there, and Freyr's\n\n[~<Prose~>. ~<Ægir~>: the sea-god; Snorri gives Hler as another of his names, but he is not elsewhere called Gymir, which is the name of the giant, Gerth's father, in the Skirnismol. On Ægir cf. ~<Grimnismol~>, 45, and ~<Hymiskvitha~>, 1. ~<Frigg~>: though Othin's wife is often mentioned, she plays only a minor part in the Eddic poems; cf. ~<Voluspo~>, 34, ~<Vafthruthnismol~>, I, and ~<Grimnismol~>, introductory prose. ~<Thor~>: the compiler is apparently a trifle confused as to Thor's movements; the \"Journey in the East\" here mentioned cannot be the one described in the ~<Hymiskvitha~>, nor yet the one narrated by Snorri, as Loki was with Thor through out that expedition. He probably means no more than that Thor was off killing giants. ~<Sif~>: concerning Thor's wife the chief incident is that Loki cut off her hair, and, at the command of the wrathful Thor, was compelled to have the dwarfs fashion her a new supply of hair out of gold; cf. ~<Harbarthsljoth~>, 48. ~<Bragi~>: the god of poetry; cf. ~<Grimnismol~>, 44 and note. ~<Ithun~>: the goddess of youth; cf. note on ~<Skirnismol~>, 19. Ithun is not mentioned by name in any other of the Eddic poems, but Snorri tells in detail how the giant Thjazi stole her and her apples, explaining the reference in ~<Harbarthsljoth~>, 19 (q. v.). ~<Tyr~>: the god of battle; cf. ~<Hymiskvitha~>, 4, and (concerning his dealings with the wolf Fenrir) ~<Voluspo~>, 39, note. ~<Njorth~>: the chief of the Wanes, and father of Freyr and Freyja; cf. (concerning the whole family) ~<Skirnismol~>, introductory prose and note, also ~<Voluspo~>, 21 and note. ~<Skathi~>: Njorth's wife was the daughter of the giant Thjazi; cf. ~<Harbarthsljoth~>, 19, note, and ~<Grimnismol~>, 17. ~<Vithar~>: the silent god, the son of Othin who avenged his father by slaying the wolf Fenrir; cf. ~<Voluspo~>, 54, ~<Vafthruthnismol~>, 51, and ~<Grimnismol~>, 17. ~<Loki~>: the mischief-making fire-god; in addition to the many references to his career in the Lokasenna, cf. particularly ~<Voluspo~>, 32 and 35, and notes. ~<Byggvir~> ~<and~> ~<Beyla~>: not mentioned elsewhere in the poems; Freyr's conspicuous servant is Skirnir, hero of the Skirnismol. ~<Fimafeng~> (\"The Swift Handler\")]",

Glittering gold they had in place of firelight; the ale came in of itself; and great was the peace. The guests praised much the ability of Ægir's serving-men. Loki might not endure that, and he slew Fimafeng. Then the gods shook their shields and howled at Loki and drove him away to the forest, and thereafter set to drinking again. Loki turned back, and outside he met Eldir. Loki spoke to him:\n\n1. \"Speak now, Eldir, | for not one step\nFarther shalt thou fare;\nWhat ale-talk here | do they have within,\nThe sons of the glorious gods?\"\n\n~<Eldir spake:~>\n2. \"Of their weapons they talk, | and their might in war,\nThe sons of the glorious gods;\nFrom the gods and elves | who are gathered here\nNo friend in words shalt thou find.\"\n\n~<Loki spake:~>\n3. \"In shall I go | into Ægir's hall,\nFor the feast I fain would see;\n\n[and ~<Eldir~> (\"The Man of the Fire\"): mentioned only in connection with this incident. ~<Glittering~> ~<gold~>: Ægir's use of gold to light his hall, which was often thought of as under the sea, was responsible for the phrase \"flame of the flood,\" and sundry kindred phrases, meaning \"gold.\"]",

Why Loki taunts him with cowardice (stanzas 11-13-15) is not clear, for poetry, of which Bragi was the patron, was generally associated in the Norse mind with peculiar valor, and most of the skaldic poets were likewise noted fighters.\n\n9. There exists no account of any incident in which Othin and Loki thus swore blood-brotherhood, but they were so often allied in enterprises that the idea is wholly reasonable. The common process of \"mingling blood\" was carried out quite literally, and the promise of -which Loki speaks is characteristic of those which, in the sagas, often accompanied the ceremony; cf. Brot af Sigurtharkvithu, 18 and note.\n\n10. In stanzas 10-31 the manuscript has nothing to indicate the identity of the several speakers, but these are uniformly clear]",

The goddesses who, finding that their husbands are getting the worst of it, take up the cudgels with Loki, all find themselves confronted with undeniable facts in their own careers; cf. stanzas 26 (Frigg), 52 (Skathi) and 54 (Sif). Gefjun and Freyja are silenced in similar fashion. ~<Wish-son~>: adopted son; Loki was the son of the giant Farbauti and the giantess Laufey, and hence was not of the race of the gods, but had been virtually adopted by Othin, who subsequently had good reason to regret it.]",

As for the necklace (line 3), it may be the Brisings' necklace, which appears in the ~<Thrymskvitha~> as Freyja's, but which, in some mythological writings, is assigned to Frigg.\n\n21. Snorri quotes line 1; cf. note on stanza 29.\n\n23. There is no other reference to Loki's having spent eight years underground, or to his cow-milking. On one occasion, however, he did bear offspring. A giant had undertaken to build the gods a fortress, his reward being Freyja and the sun and moon, provided the work was done by a given time. His sole helper was his horse, Svathilfari.

Snorri does not quote from it, nor, rather oddly, does the story occur in the ~<Prose~> ~<Edda~>.\n\nArtistically the ~<Thrymskvitha~> is one of the best, as it is, next to the ~<Voluspo~>, the most famous, of the entire collection. It has, indeed, been called \"the finest ballad in the world,\" and not without some reason. Its swift, vigorous action, the sharpness of its characterization and the humor of the central situation combine to make it one of the most vivid short narrative poems ever composed. Of course we know nothing specific of its author, but there can be no question that he was a poet of extraordinary ability. The poem assumed its present form, most critics agree, somewhere about 900, and thus it is one of the oldest in the collection. It has been suggested, on the basis of stylistic similarity, that its author may also have composed the ~<Skirnismol~>, and possibly ~<Baldrs~> ~<Draumar~>. There is also some resemblance between the ~<Thrymskvitha~> and the ~<Lokasenna~> (note, in this connection, Bugge's suggestion that the ~<Skirnismol~> and the ~<Lokasenna~> may have been by the same man), and it is not impossible that all four poems have a single authorship.\n\nThe ~<Thrymskvitha~> has been preserved in excellent condition, without any serious gaps or interpolations.

					"~<Alvissmol~>\n\n~<The Ballad of Alvis~>\n\n~<Introductory Note~>\n\nNo better summary of the Alvissmol can be given than Gering's statement that \"it is a versified chapter from the skaldic Poetics.\" The narrative skeleton, contained solely in stanzas 1-8 and in 35, is of the slightest; the dwarf Alvis, desirous of marrying Thor's daughter, is compelled by the god to answer a number of questions to test his knowledge. That all his answers are quite satisfactory makes no difference whatever to the outcome. The questions and answers differ radically from those of the ~<Vafthruthnismol~>. Instead of being essentially mythological, they all concern synonyms. Thor asks what the earth, the sky, the moon, and so on, are called \"in each of all the worlds,\" but there is no apparent significance in the fact that the gods call the earth one thing and the giants call it another; the answers are simply strings of poetic circumlocutions, or \"kennings.\" Concerning the use of these \"kennings\" in skaldic poetry, cf. introductory note to the ~<Hymiskvitha~>.\n\nMogk is presumably right in dating the poem as late as the twelfth century, assigning it to the period of \"the Icelandic renaissance of skaldic poetry.\" It appears to have been the work of a man skilled in poetic construction,--Thor's questions, for instance, are neatly balanced in pairs,--and fully familiar with the intricacies of skaldic diction, but distinctly weak in his mythology. In other words, it is learned rather than spontaneous poetry. Finnur Jonsson's attempt to make it a tenth century Norwegian poem baffles logic. Vigfusson is pretty sure the poem shows marked traces of Celtic influence, which is by no means incompatible with Mogk's theory (cf. introductory note to the ~<Rigsthula~>).\n\nThe poem is found only in ~<Regius~>, where it follows the Thrymskvitha. Snorri quotes stanzas 2c, and 30, the manuscripts of the ~<Prose Edda~> giving the name of the poem as ~<Alvissmol~>, ~<Alsvinnsmol~> or ~<Olvismol~>. It is apparently in excellent condition, without serious errors of transmission, although interpolations or omissions in such a poem might have been made so easily as to defy detection.\n\nThe translation of the many synonyms presents, of course,",

It is preserved in various late paper manuscripts, with the title ~<Vegtamskvitha~> (The Lay of Vegtam), which has been used by some editors.\n\nThe poem, which contains but fourteen stanzas, has apparently been preserved in excellent condition. Its subject-matter and style link it closely with the Voluspo. Four of the five lines of stanza 11 appear, almost without change, in the ~<Voluspo~>, 32-33, and the entire poem is simply an elaboration of the episode outlined in those and the preceding stanzas. It has been suggested that ~<Baldrs~> ~<Draumar~> and the Voluspo may have been by the same author. There is also enough similarity in style between ~<Baldrs~> ~<Draumar~> and the ~<Thrymskvitha~> (note especially the opening stanza) to give color to Vigfusson's guess that these two poems had a common authorship. In any case, ~<Baldrs~> ~<Draumar~> presumably assumed its present form not later than the first half of the tenth century.\n\nWhether the Volva (wise-woman) of the poem is identical with the speaker in the ~<Voluspo~> is purely a matter for conjecture. Nothing definitely opposes such a supposition. As in the longer poem she foretells the fall of the gods, so in this case she prophesies the first incident of that fall, the death of Baldr. Here she is called up from the dead by Othin, anxious to know the meaning of Baldr's evil dreams; in the ~<Voluspo~> it is likewise intimated that the Volva has risen from the grave.\n\nThe poem, like most of the others in the collection, is essentially dramatic rather than narrative, summarizing a story which was doubtless familiar to every one who heard the poem recited.\n__________________\n\n1.

					"~<Rigsthula~>\n\n~<The Song of Rig~>\n\n~<Introductory Note~>\n\nThe ~<Rigsthula~> is found in neither of the principal codices. The only manuscript containing it is the so-called ~<Codex~> ~<Wormanius~>, a manuscript of Snorri's ~<Prose~> ~<Edda~>. The poem appears on the last sheet of this manuscript, which unluckily is incomplete, and thus the end of the poem is lacking. In the ~<Codex~> ~<Wormanius~> itself the poem has no title, but a fragmentary parchment included with it calls the poem the ~<Rigsthula~>. Some late paper manuscripts give it the title of ~<Rigsmol~>.\n\nThe ~<Rigsthula~> is essentially unlike anything else which editors have agreed to include in the so-called ~<Edda~>. It is a definitely cultural poem, explaining, on a mythological basis, the origin of the different castes of early society: the thralls, the peasants, and the warriors. From the warriors, finally, springs one who is destined to become a king, and thus the whole poem is a song in praise of the royal estate. This fact in itself would suffice to indicate that the ~<Rigsthula~> was not composed in Iceland, where for centuries kings were regarded with profound disapproval.\n\nNot only does the ~<Rigsthula~> praise royalty, but it has many of the earmarks of a poem composed in praise of a particular king. The manuscript breaks off at a most exasperating point, just as the connection between the mythical \"Young Kon\" (Konr ungr, konungr, \"king\"; but cf. stanza 44, note) and the monarch in question is about to be established. Owing to the character of the Norse settlements in Iceland, Ireland, and the western islands generally, search for a specific king leads back to either Norway or Denmark; despite the arguments advanced by Edzardi, Vigfusson, Powell, and others, it seems most improbable that such a poem should have been produced elsewhere than on the Continent, the region where Scandinavian royalty most flourished. Finnur Jonsson's claim for Norway, with Harald the Fair-Haired as the probable king in question, is much less impressive than Mogk's ingenious demonstration that the poem was in all probability composed in Denmark, in honor of either Gorm the Old or Harald Blue-Tooth. His proof is based chiefly on the evidence provided by stanza 49, and is summarized in the note to that stanza.",
					
					"The poet, however, was certainly not a Dane, but probably a wandering Norse singer, who may have had a dozen homes, and who clearly had spent much time in some part of the western island world chiefly inhabited by Celts. The extent of Celtic influence on the Eddic poems in general is a matter of sharp dispute. Powell, for example, claims almost all the poems for the \"Western Isles,\" and attributes nearly all their good qualities to Celtic influence. Without here attempting to enter into the details of the argument, it may be said that the weight of authoritative opinion, while clearly recognizing the marks of Celtic influence in the poems, is against this view; contact between the roving Norsemen of Norway and Iceland and the Celts of Ireland and the \"Western Isles,\" and particularly the Orkneys, was so extensive as to make the presumption of an actual Celtic home for the poems seem quite unnecessary.\n\nIn the case of the ~<Rigsthula~> the poet unquestionably had not only picked up bits of the Celtic speech (the name Rig itself is almost certainly of Celtic origin, and there are various other Celtic words employed), but also had caught something of the Celtic literary spirit. This explains the cultural nature of the poem, quite foreign to Norse poetry in general. On the other hand, the style as a whole is vigorously Norse, and thus the explanation that the poem was composed by an itinerant Norse poet who had lived for some time in the Celtic islands, and who was on a visit to the court of a Danish king, fits the ascertainable facts exceedingly well. As Christianity was introduced into Denmark around 960, the ~<Rigsthula~> is not likely to have been composed much after that date, and probably belongs to the first half of the tenth century. Gorm the Old died about the year 935, and was succeeded by Harald Blue-Tooth, who died about 985.\n\nThe fourteenth (or late thirteenth) century annotator identifies Rig with Heimdall, but there is nothing in the poem itself, and very little anywhere else, to warrant this, and it seems likely that the poet had Othin, and not Heimdall, in mind, his purpose being to trace the origin of the royal estate to the chief of the gods. The evidence bearing on this identification is briefly summed up in the note on the introductory prose passage, but the question involves complex and baffling problems in mythology, and from very early times the status of Heimdall was unquestionably confusing to the Norse mind.",
					
					"They tell in old stories that one of the gods, whose name was Heimdall, went on his way along a certain seashore, and came to a dwelling, where he called himself Rig. According to these stories is the following poem:\n\n1. Men say there went | by ways so green\nOf old the god, | the aged and wise,\nMighty and strong | did Rig go striding.\n. . . . . . . . . .\n\n[~<Prose~>. It would be interesting to know how much the annotator meant by the phrase ~<old~> ~<stories~>. Was he familiar with the tradition in forms other than that of the poem? If so, his introductory note was scanty, for, outside of identifying ~<Rig~> as ~<Heimdall~>, he provides no information not found in the poem. Probably he meant simply to refer to the poem itself as a relic of antiquity, and the identification of Rig as Heimdall may well have been an attempt at constructive criticism of his own. The note was presumably written somewhere about 1300, or even later, and there is no reason for crediting the annotator with any considerable knowledge of mythology. There is little to favor the identification of Rig with Heimdall, the watchman of the gods, beyond a few rather vague passages in the other poems. Thus in ~<Voluspo~>, I, the Volva asks hearing \"from Heimdall's sons both high and low\"; in ~<Grimnismol~>, 13, there is a very doubtful line which may mean that Heimdall \"o'er men holds sway, it is said,\" and in \"the Short Voluspo\" (~<Hyndluljoth~>, 40) he is called \"the kinsman of men.\" On the other hand, everything in the ~<Rigsthula~>, including the phrase \"the aged and wise\" in stanza I, and the references to runes in stanzas 36, 44, and 46, fits Othin exceedingly well. It seems probable that the annotator was wrong, and that Rig is Othin, and not Heimdall. ~<Rig~>: almost certainly based on the Old Irish word for \"king,\" \"ri\" or \"rig.\"\n\n1. No gap is indicated, but editors have generally assumed one. Some editors, however, add line 1 of stanza 2 to stanza 1.]",

After line 1 the manuscript has only four words: \"cloth,\" \"black,\" \"named,\" and \"Thræll.\" No gap is anywhere indicated.

He married the daughter of a certain Danp, lord of Danpsted, whose name was Dana; and later, having won the royal title for his province, left as his heir his son by Dana, called Dan or Danum, all of whose subjects were called Danes.\" This may or may not be conclusive, and it is a great pity that the manuscript breaks off abruptly at this stanza.]"

					"~<Hyndluljoth~>\n\n~<The Poem of Hyndla~>\n\n~<Introductory Note~>\n\nThe Hyndluljoth is found in neither of the great manuscripts of the Poetic Edda, but is included in the so-called ~<Flateyjarbok~> (Book of the Flat Island), an enormous compilation made some where about 1400. The lateness of this manuscript would of itself be enough to cast a doubt upon the condition in which the poem has been preserved, and there can be no question that what we have of it is in very poor shape. It is, in fact, two separate poems, or parts of them, clumsily put together. The longer one, the ~<Poem~> ~<of~> ~<Hyndla~> proper, is chiefly a collection of names, not strictly mythological but belonging to the semi-historical hero-sagas of Norse tradition. The wise-woman, Hyndla, being asked by Freyja to trace the ancestry of her favorite, Ottar, for the purpose of deciding a wager, gives a complex genealogy including many of the heroes who appear in the popular sagas handed down from days long before the Icelandic settlements. The poet was learned, but without enthusiasm; it is not likely that he composed the ~<Hyndluljoth~> much before the twelfth century, though the material of which it is compounded must have been very much older. Although the genealogies are essentially continental, the poem seems rather like a product of the archæological period of Iceland.\n\nInserted bodily in the ~<Hyndluljoth~> proper is a fragment of fifty-one lines, taken from a poem of which, by a curious chance, we know the name. Snorri quotes one stanza of it, calling it \"the short ~<Voluspo~>.\" The fragment preserved gives, of course, no indication of the length of the original poem, but it shows that it was a late and very inferior imitation of the great ~<Voluspo~>. Like the Hyndluljoth proper, it apparently comes from the twelfth century; but there is nothing whatever to indicate that the two poems were the work of the same man, or were ever connected in any way until some blundering copyist mixed them up. Certainly the connection did not exist in the middle of the thirteenth century, when Snorri quoted \"the short ~<Voluspo~>.\"\n\nNeither poem is of any great value, either as mythology or as poetry. The author of \"the short ~<Voluspo~>\" seems, indeed, to have been more or less confused as to his facts; and both poets were",
					
					"too late to feel anything of the enthusiasm of the earlier school. The names of Hyndla's heroes, of course, suggest an unlimited number of stories, but as most of these have no direct relation to the poems of the ~<Edda~>, I have limited the notes to a mere record of who the persons mentioned were, and the saga-groups in which they appeared.\n\n~<Freyja spake:~>\n1. \"Maiden, awake! | wake thee, my friend,\nMy sister Hyndla, | in thy hollow cave!\nAlready comes darkness, | and ride must we\nTo Valhall to seek | the sacred hall.\n\n2. \"The favor of Heerfather | seek we to find,\nTo his followers gold | he gladly gives;\nTo Hermoth gave he | helm and mail-coat,\nAnd to Sigmund he gave | a sword as gift.\n\n[1. Freyja: The names of the speakers do not appear in the manuscripts. On Freyja cf. ~<Voluspo~>, 21 and note; ~<Skirnismol~>, introductory prose and note; ~<Lokasenna~>, introductory prose and note. As stanzas 9-10 show, Ottar has made a wager of his entire inheritance with Angantyr regarding the relative loftiness of their ancestry, and by rich offerings (Hyndla hints at less commendable methods) has induced Freyja to assist him in establishing his genealogy. Freyja, having turned Ottar for purposes of disguise into a boar, calls on the giantess Hyndla (\"She-Dog\") to aid her. Hyndla does not appear elsewhere in the poems.\n\n2. ~<Heerfather~>: Othin; cf. ~<Voluspo~>, 30. Hermoth: mentioned in the ~<Prose~> ~<Edda~> as a son of Othin who is sent to Hel to ask for the return of the slain Baldr. ~<Sigmund~>: according to the ~<Volsungasaga~> Sigmund was the son of Volsung, and hence Othin's great-great-grandson (note that Wagner eliminates all the intervening generations by the simple expedient of using]",

Sigmund alone was able to draw from the tree the sword which a mysterious stranger (Othin, of course) had thrust into it (compare the first act of Wagner's ~<Die~> ~<Walküre~>).\n\n3. Sijmons suggests that this stanza may be an interpolation.\n\n4. No lacuna after line 2 is indicated in the manuscript. Editors have attempted various experiments in rearranging this and the following stanza.\n\n5. Some editors, following Simrock, assign this whole stanza to Hyndla; others assign to her lines 3-4. Giving the entire stanza to Freyja makes better sense than any other arrangement, but is dependent on changing the manuscript's \"thy\" in line 3 to \"my\", as suggested by Bugge. The boar on which Freyja rides (\"my worthy steed\") is, of course, Ottar.\n\n6. Hyndla detects Ottar, and accuses Freyja of having her]",

Voluspo, 25 and note), which seems most unlikely, there is no other reference to this love affair. ~<The~> ~<way~> ~<of~> ~<the~> ~<slain~>: the road to Valhall.\n\n7. Various experiments have been made in condensing the stanza into four lines, or in combining it with stanza 8. ~<Hildisvini~> (\"Battle-Swine\"): perhaps Freyja refers to the boar with golden bristles given, according to Snorri, to her brother Freyr by the dwarfs. ~<Dain~>: a dwarf; cf. ~<Voluspo~>, 11. ~<Nabbi~>: a dwarf nowhere else mentioned.\n\n8. The first line is obviously corrupt in the manuscript, and has been variously emended. The general assumption is that in the interval between stanzas 7 and 8 Freyja and Hyndla have arrived at Valhall. No lacuna is indicated in the manuscript.\n\n9. ~<Foreign~> ~<metal~>: gold.

					"~<Svipdagsmol~>\n\n~<The Ballad of Svipdag~>\n\n~<Introductory Note~>\n\nThe two poems, ~<Grougaldr~> (~<Groa's~> ~<Spell~>) and ~<Fjolsvinnsmol~> (the ~<Ballad~> ~<of~> ~<Fjolsvith~>), which many editors have, very wisely, united under the single title of Svipdagsmol, are found only in paper manuscripts, none of them antedating the seventeenth century. Everything points to a relatively late origin for the poems: their extensive use of \"kennings\" or poetical circumlocutions, their romantic spirit, quite foreign to the character of the unquestionably older poems, the absence of any reference to them in the earlier documents, the frequent errors in mythology, and, finally, the fact that the poems appear to have been preserved in unusually good condition. Whether or not a connecting link of narrative verse joining the two parts has been lost is an open question; on the whole it seems likely that the story was sufficiently well known so that the reciter of the poem (or poems) merely filled in the gap with a brief prose summary in pretty much his own words. The general relationship between dialogue and narrative in the Eddic poems is discussed in the introductory note to the ~<Grimnismol~>, in connection with the use of prose links.\n\nThe love story of Svipdag and Mengloth is not referred to elsewhere in the ~<Poetic~> ~<Edda~>, nor does Snorri mention it; however, Groa, who here appears as Svipdag's mother, is spoken of by Snorri as a wise woman, the wife of Orvandil, who helps Thor with her magic charms. On the other hand, the essence of the story, the hero's winning of a bride ringed about by flames, is strongly suggestive of parts of the Sigurth-Brynhild traditions. Whether or not it is to be regarded as a nature or solar myth depends entirely on one's view of the whole \"solar myth\" school of criticism, not so highly esteemed today as formerly; such an interpretation is certainly not necessary to explain what is, under any circumstances, a very charming romance told, in the main, with dramatic effectiveness.\n\nIn later years the story of Svipdag and Mengloth became popular throughout the North, and was made the subject of many Danish and Swedish as well as Norwegian ballads. These have greatly assisted in the reconstruction of the outlines of the narrative surrounding the dialogue poems here given.",

					"~<Völundarkvitha~>\n\n~<The Lay of Völund~>\n\n~<Introductory Note~>\n\nBetween the ~<Thrymskvitha~> and the ~<Alvissmol~> in the ~<Codex~> ~<Regius~> stands the ~<Völundarkvitha~>. It was also included in the ~<Arnamagnæan~> ~<Codex~>, but unluckily it begins at the very end of the fragment which has been preserved, and thus only a few lines of the opening prose remain. This is doubly regrettable because the text in ~<Regius~> is unquestionably in very bad shape, and the other manuscript would doubtless have been of great assistance in the reconstruction of the poem.\n\nThere has been a vast amount written regarding the Weland tradition as a whole, discussing particularly the relations between the ~<Völundarkvitha~> and the Weland passage in ~<Deor's~> ~<Lament~>. There can be little question that the story came to the North from Saxon regions, along with many of the other early hero tales. In stanza 16 the Rhine is specifically mentioned as the home of treasure; and the presence of the story in Anglo-Saxon poetry probably as early as the first part of the eighth century proves beyond a doubt that the legend cannot have been a native product of Scandinavia. In one form or another, however, the legend of the smith persisted for centuries throughout all the Teutonic lands, and the name of Wayland Smith is familiar to all readers of Walter Scott, and even of Rudyard Kipling's tales of England.\n\nIn what form this story reached the North is uncertain. Sundry striking parallels between the diction of the ~<Völundarkvitha~> and that of the Weland passage in ~<Deor's~> ~<Lament~> make it distinctly probable that a Saxon song on this subject had found its way to Scandinavia or Iceland. But the prose introduction to the poem mentions the \"old sagas\" in which Völund was celebrated, and in the ~<Thithrekssaga~> we have definite evidence of the existence of such prose narrative in the form of the ~<Velentssaga~> (Velent, Völund, Weland, and Wayland all being, of course, identical), which gives a long story for which the ~<Völundarkvitha~> can have supplied relatively little, if any, of the material. It is probable, then, that Weland stories were current in both prose and verse in Scandinavia as early as the latter part of the ninth century.",
					
					"Once let a figure become popular in oral tradition, and the number and variety of the incidents connected with his name will increase very rapidly. Doubtless there were scores of Weland stories current in the eighth, ninth, and tenth centuries, many of them with very little if any traditional authority. The main one, however, the story of the laming of the smith by King Nithuth (or by some other enemy) and of Weland's terrible revenge, forms the basis of the ~<Völundarkvitha~>. To this, by way of introduction, has been added the story of Völund and the wan-maiden, who, to make things even more complex, is likewise aid to be a Valkyrie. Some critics maintain that these two sections were originally two distinct poems, merely strung together by the compiler with the help of narrative prose links; but the poem as a whole has a kind of dramatic unity which suggests rather that an early poet--for linguistically the poem belongs among the oldest of the Eddic collection--used two distinct legends, whether in prose or verse, as the basis for the composition of a new and homogeneous poem.\n\nThe swan-maiden story appears, of course, in many places quite distinct from the Weland tradition, and, in another form, became one of the most popular of German folk tales. Like the story of Weland, however, it is of German rather than Scandinavian origin, and the identification of the swan-maidens as Valkyries, which may have taken place before the legend reached the North, may, on the other hand, have been simply an attempt to connect southern tradition with figures well known in northern mythology.\n\nThe ~<Völundarkvitha~> is full of prose narrative links, including an introduction. The nature of such prose links has already been discussed in the introductory note to the ~<Grimnismol~>; the ~<Völundarkvitha~> is a striking illustration of the way in which the function of the earlier Eddic verse was limited chiefly to dialogue or description, the narrative outline being provided, if at all, in prose. This prose was put in by each reciter according to his fancy and knowledge, and his estimate of his hearers' need for such explanations; some of it, as in this instance, eventually found its way into the written record.\n\nThe manuscript of the ~<Völundarkvitha~> is in such bad shape, and the conjectural emendations have been so numerous, that in the notes I have attempted to record only the most important of them.",
					
					"There was a king in Sweden named Nithuth. He had two sons and one daughter; her name was Bothvild. There were three brothers, sons of a king of the Finns: one was called Slagfith, another Egil, the third Völund. They went on snowshoes and hunted wild beasts. They came into Ulfdalir and there they built themselves a house; there was a lake there which is called Ulfsjar. Early one morning they found on the shore of the lake three women, who were spinning flax. Near them were their swan garments, for they were Valkyries. Two of them were daughters of King Hlothver, Hlathguth the Swan-White and Hervor the All-Wise, and the third was Olrun, daughter of Kjar from Valland. These did they bring\n\n[~<Prose~>. ~<Nithuth> (\"Bitter Hater\"): here identified as a king of Sweden, is in the poem (stanzas 9, 15 and 32) called lord of the Njars, which may refer to the people of the Swedish district of Nerike. In any case, the scene of the story has moved from Saxon lands into the Northeast. The first and last sentences of the introduction refer to the second part of the poem; the rest of it concerns the swan-maidens episode. ~<Bothvild~> (\"Warlike Maid\"): Völund's victim in the latter part of the poem. ~<King~> ~<of~> ~<the~> ~<Finns~>: this notion, clearly later than the poem, which calls Völund an elf, may perhaps be ascribed to the annotator who composed the prose introduction. The Finns, meaning the dwellers in Lapland, were generally credited with magic powers. ~<Egil~> appears in the ~<Thithrekssaga~> as Völund's brother, but ~<Slagfith~> is not elsewhere mentioned. ~<Ulfdalir~> (\"Wolf-Dale\"), ~<Ulfsjar~> (\"Wolf-Sea\"), ~<Valland~> (\"Slaughter-Land\"): mythical, places without historical identification. ~<Valkyries~>: cf. ~<Voluspo~>, 31 and note; there is nothing in the poem to identify the three swan maidens as Valkyries except one obscure word in line 2 of stanza 1 and again in line 5 of stanza 5, which may mean, as Gering translates it, \"helmed,\" or else \"fair and wise.\" I suspect that the annotator, anxious to give the Saxon legend as much northern local color as possible, was mistaken in his mythology, and that]",
					
					"home to their hall with them. Egil took Olrun, and Slagfith Swan-White, and Völund All-Wise. There they dwelt seven winters; but then they flew away to find battles, and came back no more. Then Egil set forth on his snowshoes to follow Olrun, and Slagfith followed Swan White, but Völund stayed in Ulfdalir. He was a most skillful man, as men know from old tales. King Nithuth had him taken by force, as the poem here tells.\n\n1. Maids from the south | through Myrkwood flew,\nFair and young, | their fate to follow;\nOn the shore of the sea | to rest them they sat,\nThe maids of the south, | and flax they spun.\n\n[the poet never conceived of his swan-maidens as Valkyries at all. However, this identification of swan-maidens with Valkyries was not uncommon; cf. ~<Helreith~> ~<Brynhildar~>, 7. The three maidens' names, ~<Hlathguth~>, ~<Hervor~>, and ~<Olrun~>, do not appear in the lists of Valkyries. ~<King~> ~<Hlothver~>: this name suggests the southern origin of the story, as it is the northern form of Ludwig; the name appears again in ~<Guthrunarkvitha~> II, 26, and that of ~<Kjar~> is found in ~<Atlakvitha~>, 7, both of these poems being based on German stories. It is worth noting that the composer of this introductory note seems to have had little or no information beyond what was actually contained in the poem as it has come down to us; he refers to the \"old stories\" about Völund, but either he was unfamiliar with them in detail or else he thought it needless to make use of them. His note simply puts in clear and connected form what the verse tells somewhat obscurely; his only additions are making Nithuth a king of Sweden and Völund's father a king of the Finns, supplying the name Ulfsjar for the lake, identifying the swan-maidens as Valkyries, and giving Kjar a home in Valland.\n\n1.

If lines 1-2 belong to Völund, they mean that Nithuth got his wealth in the Rhine country, and that Völund's hoard has nothing to do with it; if the speaker is Nithuth, they mean that Völund presumably has not killed a dragon, and that he is far from the wealth of the Rhine, so that he must have stolen his treasure from Nithuth himself.\n\n17. Line 1 is lacking in the manuscript, lines 2-4 following immediately after the two lines here given as stanza 2.

					"~<Helgakvitha Hjorvarthssonar~>\n\n~<The Lay of Helgi the Son of Hjorvarth~>\n\n~<Introductory Note~>\n\nThe three Helgi lays, all found in the ~<Codex~> ~<Regius~>, have been the subjects of a vast amount of discussion, in spite of which many of the facts regarding them are still very far from settled. It is, indeed, scarcely possible to make any unqualified statement regarding these three poems for which a flat contradiction cannot be found in the writings of some scholar of distinction. The origin of the Helgi tradition, its connection with that of Sigurth, the authorship, date and home of the poems, the degree to which they have been altered from their original forms, the status of the composer of the copious prose notes: these and many other allied questions have been and probably always will be matters of dispute among students of the ~<Edda's~> history.\n\nWithout attempting to enter into the discussion in detail, certain theories should be noted. Helgi appears originally to have been a Danish popular hero, the son of King Halfdan. Saxo Grammaticus has a good deal to say about him in that capacity, and it has been pointed out that many of the place names in the Helgi lays can be pretty clearly identified with parts of Denmark and neighboring stretches of the Baltic. The Danish Helgi, according to Saxo, was famed as the conqueror of Hunding and Hothbrodd, the latter as the result of a naval expedition at the head of a considerable fleet.\n\nFrom Denmark the story appears to have spread northward into Norway and westward into the Norse settlements among the islands. Not many of its original features remained, and new ones were added here and there, particularly with regard to Helgi's love affair with Sigrun. The victories over Hunding and Hothbrodd, however, were generally retained, and out of material relating to these two fights, and to the Helgi-Sigrun story, were fashioned the two lays of Helgi Hundingsbane.\n\nHow the Helgi legend became involved with that of the Volsungs is an open question. Both stories travelled from the South, and presumably about the same time, so it is not unnatural",
					
					"that some confusion should have arisen. At no time, however, was the connection particularly close so far as the actual episodes of the two stories were concerned. In the two lays of Helgi Hundingsbane the relationship is established only by the statement that Helgi was the son of Sigmund and Borghild; Sigurth is not mentioned, and in the lay of Helgi the son of Hjorvarth there is no connection at all. On the other hand, Helgi does not appear in any of the Eddic poems dealing directly with the Volsung stories, although in one passage of doubtful authenticity (cf. ~<Reginsmol~>, introductory note) his traditional enemy, Hunding, does, represented by his sons. In the ~<Volsungasaga~> the story of Helgi, including the fights with Hunding and Hothbrodd and the love affair with Sigrun, is told in chapters 8 and 9 without otherwise affecting the course of the narrative. Here, as in the Helgi lays, Helgi is the son of Sigmund Volsungsson and Borghild; Sigurth, on the other hand, is the son of Sigmund and Hjordis, the latter being the daughter of King Eylimi. Still another son, who complicates both stories somewhat, is Sinfjotli, son of Sigmund and his own sister, Signy. Sinfjotli appears in both of the Helgi Hundingsbane lays and in the ~<Volsungasaga~>, but not in any of the Eddic poems belonging to the Volsung cycle (cf. ~<Fra~> ~<Dautha~> ~<Sinfjotla~> and note).\n\nThere is a certain amount of resemblance between the story of Helgi and Sigrun and that of Sigurth and Brynhild, particularly as the annotator responsible for the prose notes insists that Sigrun was a Valkyrie. Whether this resemblance was the cause of bringing the two stories together, or whether the identification of Helgi as Sigmund's son resulted in alterations of the love story in the Helgi poems, cannot be determined. The first of the three Helgi poems, the lay of Helgi the son of Hjorvarth, is a somewhat distant cousin of the other two. The Helgi in question is apparently the same traditional figure, and he leads a naval expedition, but he is not the son of Sigmund, there is no connection with the Volsung cycle, and his wife is Svava, not Sigrun. At the same time, the points of general resemblance with the two Helgi Hundingsbane lays are such as to indicate a common origin, provided one goes far enough back. The annotator brings the stories together by the naive expedient of having Helgi \"born again,\" and not once only, but twice.",
					
					"The first Helgi lay, is manifestly in bad shape, and includes at least two distinct poems, differentiated not only by subject matter but by metrical form. Although the question is debatable, the longer of these poems (stanzas 1-11 and 31-43) seems in turn to have been compounded out of fragments of two or more Helgi poems. The first five stanzas are a dialogue between a bird and Atli, one of Hjorvarth's followers, concerning the winning of Sigrlin, who is destined to be Hjorvarth's wife and Helgi's mother. Stanzas 6-11 are a dialogue between Helgi and a Valkyrie (the accompanying prose so calls her, and identifies her as Svava, but there is nothing in the verse to prove this). Stanzas 12-30 form a fairly consecutive unit, in which Atli, on guard over Helgi's ship, has a vigorous argument with a giantess, Hrimgerth, whence this section has sometimes been called the ~<Hrimgertharmol~> (~<Lay~> ~<of~> ~<Hrimgerth~>). The last section, stanzas 31-43, is, again fairly consecutive, and tells of the death of Helgi following the rash oath of his brother, Hethin, to win Svava for himself.\n\nParts I, II, and IV may all have come from the same poem or they may not; it is quite impossible to tell surely. All of them are generally dated by commentators not later than the first half of the tenth century, whereas the ~<Hrimgertharmol~> (section III) is placed considerably later. When and by whom these fragments were pieced together is another vexed question, and this involves a consideration of the prose notes and links, of which the ~<Helgakvitha ~<Hjorvarthssonar~> has a larger amount than any other poem in the ~<Edda~>. These prose links contain practically all the narrative, the verse being almost exclusively dialogue. Whoever composed them seems to have been consciously trying to bring his chaotic verse material into some semblance of unity, but he did his work pretty clumsily, with manifest blunders and contradictions. Bugge has advanced the theory that these prose passages are to be regarded as an original and necessary part of the work, but this hardly squares with the evidence.\n\nIt seems probable, rather, that as the Helgi tradition spread from its native Denmark through the Norse regions of the North and West, and became gradually interwoven, although not in essentials, with the other great hero cycle from the South, that of the Volsungs, a considerable number of poems dealing with Helgi were composed, at different times and in different places,",
					
					"reflecting varied forms of the story. Many generations after wards, when Iceland's literary period had arrived, some zealous scribe committed to writing such poems or fragments of poems as he knew, piecing them together and annotating them on the basis of information which had reached him through other channels. The prose notes to ~<Helgakvitha~> ~<Hundingsbana~> ~<II~> frankly admit this patchwork process: a section of four stanzas (13-16) is introduced with the phrase, \"as is said in the Old Volsung Lay\"; the final prose note cites an incident \"told in the ~<Karuljoth~> (~<Lay~> ~<of~> ~<Kara~>),\" and a two-line speech is quoted \"as it was written before in the ~<Helgakvitha~>.\"\n\nThe whole problem of the origin, character and home of the Helgi poems has been discussed in great detail by Bugge in his ~<Helge-Digtene~> ~<i~> ~<den~> ~<Ældre~> ~<Edda~>, ~<Deres~> ~<Hjem~> ~<og~> ~<Forbindelser~>, which, as translated by W. H. Schofield under the title ~<The~> ~<Home~> ~<of~> ~<the~> ~<Eddic~> ~<Poems~>, is available for readers of English. This study is exceedingly valuable, if not in all respects convincing. The whole matter is so complex and so important in the history of Old Norse literature, and any intelligent reading of the Helgi poems is so dependent on an understanding of the conditions under which they have come down to us, that I have here discussed the question more extensively than the scope of a mere introductory note to a single poem would warrant.\n\n~<(I)~>\n\n~<Of Hjorvarth~> ~<and~> ~<Sigrlin~>\n\nHjorvarth was the name of a king, who had four wives: one was called Alfhild, and their son was named Hethin; the second was called Særeith, and their son was named Humlung; the third was called Sinrjoth, and their son was\n\n[~<Prose~>: In the manuscript the sub-title, \"Of Hjorvarth and Sigrlin,\" stands as the title for the whole poem, though it clearly applies only to the first five stanzas.

He learned that King Svafnir had a daughter fairer than all others, whose name was Sigrlin. Ithmund was the name of one of his jarls; he had a son called Atli, who went to woo Sigrlin on behalf of the king. He dwelt the winter long with King Svafnir. There was a jarl called Franmar, Sigrlin's foster-father; his daughter was named Alof. The jarl told him that the maiden's hand was denied, and Atli went home. Atli, the jarl's son, stood one day in a certain wood; a bird sat in the branches up over him, and it had heard that his men called Hjorvarth's wives the fairest of women. The bird twittered, and Atli hearkened to what it spoke. It said:\n\n[there are two men of that name mentioned in the mythical heroic genealogies of the ~<Hyndluljoth~> (stanzas 23 and 28), and Hjorvarth appears in ~<Helgakvitha~> ~<Hundingsbana~> I (stanza 14) and II (prose after stanza 12) as a son of Hunding. This particular Hjorvarth is called by the annotator, but not directly so in the verse, a king of Norway. The name means \"Sword-Guardian.\" ~<Four~> ~<wives~>: polygamy, while very. infrequent, appears occasionally in the Norse sagas. ~<Alfhild~>: \"Elf-Warrior.\" ~<Hethin~>: \"Fur-Clothed\" (?). ~<Særeith~>: \"Sea-Rider.\" ~<Sinrjoth~>: \"Ever-Red.\" The fourth wife, not here named, may be Sigrlin. It has been suggested that Særeith and Sinrjoth may be northern and southern forms of the same name, as also ~<Humlung~> and ~<Hymling~>, their sons. ~<Svafnir~>: the annotator calls him king of Svavaland, apparently a place on the mainland which could be reached from Norway either by land or by sea. ~<Sigrlin~>: \"The Conquering Serpent.\" ~<Atli~>: Norse form of the Gothic Attila (Etzel). ~<Alof~>: perhaps a feminine form of Olaf. ~<A~> ~<bird~>: compare the counsel given by the birds to Sigurth after the slaying of Fafnir (Fafnismol, stanzas 32-38).

The king rode from the mountain forward into the land, and made a night's stay hard by a stream. Atli kept watch and went over the stream; he found there a house. A great bird sat on the housetop to guard it, but he was asleep. Atli hurled his spear at the bird and slew it, and in the house he found Sigrlin the king's daughter and Alof the jarl's daughter, and he brought them both thence with him.

Gering thinks the reborn Helgi Hjorvarthsson was Helgi Hundingsbane, while Svava, according to the annotator himself, became Sigrun. The point seems to be simply that there were so many Helgi stories current, and the hero died in so many irreconcilable ways, that tradition had to have him born over again, not once only but several times, to accommodate his many deaths, and to avoid splitting him up into several Helgis. Needless to say, the poems themselves know nothing of this rebirth, and we owe the suggestion entirely to the annotator, who probably got it from current tradition.]"

					"~<Helgakvitha Hundingsbana I~>\n\n~<The First Lay of Helgi Hundingsbane~>\n\n~<Introductory Note~>\n\nThe general subject of the Helgi lays is considered in the introduction to ~<Helgakvitha~> ~<Hjorvarthssonar~>, and it is needless here to repeat the statements there made. The first lay of Helgi Hundingsbane is unquestionably one of the latest of the Eddic poems, and was composed probably not earlier than the second quarter of the eleventh century. It presents several unusual characteristics. For one thing, it is among the few essentially narrative poems in the whole collection, telling a consecutive story in verse, and, except for the abusive dialogue between Sinfjotli and Gothmund, which clearly was based on another and older poem, it does so with relatively little use of dialogue. It is, in fact, a ballad, and in the main an exceedingly vigorous one. The annotator, who added his prose narrative notes so freely in the other Helgi poems, here found nothing to do. The available evidence indicates that narrative verse was a relatively late development in Old Norse poetry, and it is significant that most of the poems which consist chiefly, not of dialogue, but of narrative stanzas, such as the first Helgi Hundingsbane lay and the two Atli lays, can safely be dated, on the basis of other evidence, after the year 1000.\n\nThe first Helgi Hundingsbane lay is again differentiated from most of the Eddic poems by the character of its language. It is full of those verbal intricacies which were the delight of the Norse skalds, and which made Snorri's dictionary of poetic phrases an absolute necessity. Many of these I have paraphrased in the translation; some I have simplified or wholly avoided. A single line will serve to indicate the character of this form of complex diction (stanza 56, line 4): \"And the horse of the giantess raven's-food had.\" This means simply that wolves (giantesses habitually rode on wolves) ate the bodies of the dead.\n\nExcept for its intricacies of diction, and the possible loss of a stanza here and there, the poem is comparatively simple. The story belongs in all its essentials to the Helgi tradition, with the Volsung cycle brought in only to the extent of making Helgi the son of Sigmund, and in the introduction of Sinfjotli, son of Sigmund and his sister Signy, in a passage which has",
					
					"little or nothing to do with the course of the narrative, and which looks like an expansion of a passage from some older poem, perhaps from the \"old Volsung lay\" to which the annotator of the second Helgi Hundingsbane lay refers (prose after stanza 12). There are many proper names, some of which betray the confusion caused by the blending of the two sets of traditions; for example, Helgi appears indiscriminately as an Ylfing (which presumably he was before the Volsung story became involved) and as a Volsung. Granmar and his sons are called Hniflungs (Nibelungen) in stanza 50, though they seem to have had no connection with this race. The place names have aroused much debate as to the localization of the action, but while some of them probably reflect actual places, there is so much geographical confusion, and such a profusion of names which are almost certainly mythical, that it is hard to believe that the poet had any definite locations in mind.\n\n1. In olden days, | when eagles screamed,\nAnd holy streams | from heaven's crags fell,\nWas Helgi then, | the hero-hearted,\nBorghild's son, | in Bralund born.\n\n2.

Line 2 is largely guesswork, the manuscript being obscure. ~<Moon's~> ~<hall~>: the sky.\n\n4. ~<East~>, etc.: the Norris give Helgi fame in the East, West, and North; in the North his renown is particularly to endure. This suggests that the poet was aware of the spread of the Helgi story over many lands. ~<Neri's~> ~<kinswoman~>: evidently one of the Norns, but nothing further is known of Neri, and the word may not be a proper name at all.\n\n5. The manuscript indicates no gap, but it looks as though something had been lost after line 2. ~<Ylfings'~> ~<son~>: Sigmund is evidently meant, though calling him an Ylfing (cf. ~<Hyndluljoth~>, 11 and note) is a manifest error. Helgi, in the tradition as it came from Denmark, was undoubtedly an Ylfing, and the poet, in order to combine the two legends, has to treat the Ylfings and Volsungs as if they were the same family.]",
					
					"6. \"In mail-coat stands | the son of Sigmund,\nA half-day old; | now day is here;\nHis eyes flash sharp | as the heroes' are,\nHe is friend of the wolves; | full glad are we.\"\n\n7. The warrior throng | a ruler thought him,\nGood times, they said, | mankind should see;\nThe king himself | from battle-press came,\nTo give the prince | a leek full proud.\n\n8. Helgi he named him, | and Hringstathir gave him,\nSolfjoll, Snæfjoll, | and Sigarsvoll,\nHringstoth, Hotun, | and Himinvangar,\nAnd a blood-snake bedecked | to Sinfjotli's brother.\n\n[6. ~<Sigmund~>: the chief link between the Helgi and Sigurth stories. He was the son of Volsung, great-grandson of Othin. His children by his first wife, Borghild, were Helgi and Hamund (belonging to the Helgi cycle); his son by his second wife, Hjordis, was Sigurth. An incestuous connection with his sister, Signy (cf. Wagner's Siegmund and Sieglinde) resulted in the birth of Sinfjotli (cf. ~<Fra~> ~<Dautha~> ~<Sinfjotla~> and note).\n\n7. ~<The~> ~<king~>: Sigmund, who gives his son a symbol of the lands which he bestows on him. Regarding the leek, cf. ~<Voluspo~>, 4; ~<Guthrunarkvitha~> I, 17, and ~<Sigrdrifumol~>, 7.\n\n8. ~<Hringstathir~> (\"Ring-Stead\"): quite possibly the historical Ringsted, long a possession of the Danish kings, and thus a relic of the old Helgi tradition. ~<Hringstoth~> may be another form of the same name. ~<Solfjoll~> (\"Sun-Mountain\") and ~<Snæfjoll~> (\"Snow-Mountain\") are fictitious names. Regarding ~<Sigarsvoll~> cf. ~<Helgakvitha~> ~<Hjorvarthssonar~>, stanzas 8 and 35. Saxo mentions a Danish king named Sigar, and the frequency with which the name appears in the Helgi poems may be taken as a reminiscence of Denmark. ~<Hotun~> (\"High Place\"): possibly the village of Tune in Seeland. ~<Himinvangar~> (\"Heaven's Field\"): an imaginary place. Blood-snake: a sword. ~<Sinfjotli~>: cf. note on stanza 6.]",
					
					"9. Mighty he grew | in the midst of his friends,\nThe fair-born elm, | in fortune's glow;\nTo his comrades gold | he gladly gave,\nThe hero spared not | the blood-flecked hoard.\n\n10.

Of Sigmund's son | then next they sought\nHoard and rings, | the sons of Hunding;\nThey bade the prince | requital pay\nFor booty stolen | and father slain.\n\n12. The prince let not | their prayers avail,\nNor gold for their dead | did the kinsmen get;\nWaiting, he said, | was a mighty storm\nOf lances gray | and Othin's grimness.\n\n13. The warriors forth | to the battle went,\nThe field they chose | at Logafjoll;\n\n[9. ~<Elm~>: a not uncommon word for \"man.\" ~<Blood-flecked~>: i.e., won in battle.\n\n10. ~<Fifteen~>: until early in the eleventh century a Norwegian or Icelandic boy became \"of age\" at twelve, and Maurer cites this passage as added proof of the poem's lateness. Hunding: the annotator (introductory prose to ~<Helgakvitha~> ~<Hundingsbana~> II) calls him king of Hundland, which shows no great originality. Saxo mentions a Hunding who was a Saxon king ruling in Jutland, probably the origin of Helgi's traditional foe.\n\n12. ~<Storm~>, etc.: war.\n\n13. ~<Logafjoll~> (\"Flame-Mountain\"): a mythical name. ~<Frothi~>:]",
					
					"Frothi's peace | midst foes they broke,\nThrough the isle went hungrily | Vithrir's hounds.\n\n14. The king then sat, | when he had slain\nEyjolf and Alf, | 'neath the eagle-stone;\nHjorvarth and Hovarth, | Hunding's sons,\nThe kin of the spear-wielder, | all had he killed.\n\n15.

In this poem Helgi kills all the sons of Hunding, but in the poems of the Sigurth cycle, and the prose notes attached thereto, Sigmund and his father-in-law, Eylimi, are killed by Hunding's sons, on whom Sigurth subsequently takes vengeance (cf. ~<Fra~> ~<Dautha~> ~<Sinfjotla~> and ~<Reginsmol~>).\n\n15. No gap indicated in the manuscript, but almost certainly something has been lost mentioning more specifically the coming of the Valkyries. The lightning which accompanies them suggests again their identification with the clouds (cf. ~<Helgakvitha~> ~<Hjorvarthssonar~>, 28).\n\n16. Some editions fill out the first line: \"He saw there mighty maidens riding.\" The manuscript indicates line 4 as the beginning of a new stanza.]",

					"17. Early then | in wolf-wood asked\nThe mighty king | of the southern maid,\nIf with the hero | home would she\nCome that night; | the weapons clashed.\n\n18. Down from her horse | sprang Hogni's daughter,--\nThe shields were still,-- | and spake to the hero:\n\"Other tasks | are ours, methinks,\nThan drinking beer | with the breaker of rings.\n\n19. \"My father has pledged | his daughter fair\nAs bride to Granmar's | son so grim;\nBut, Helgi, I | once Hothbrodd called\nAs fine a king | as the son of a cat.\n\n[17. ~<Wolf-wood~>: dark forest; the original word is not altogether clear. ~<Southern~>: this variety of Valkyrie, like the swan maidens of the ~<Völundarkvitha~>, was clearly regarded as of southern (i.e., German) origin. Here again there is a confusion of traditions; the Valkyries of the ~<Voluspo~> were as essentially Norse as any part of the older mythology. I doubt if a poet much earlier than the author of the first Helgi Hundingsbane lay would have made his Sigrun, daughter of Hogni, a Valkyrie. It is to be noted that the same complication appears in the Sigurth story, where the undoubted Valkyrie, Brynhild-Sigrdrifa (the latter name is really only an epithet) is hopelessly mixed up with the quite human Brynhild, daughter of Buthli.\n\n18. ~<Breaker~> ~<of~> ~<rings~>: generous prince, because the breaking of rings was the customary form of distributing gold.\n\n19. ~<Granmar~>: the annotator gives an account of him and his family in the prose following stanza 12 of ~<Helgakvitha~> ~<Hundingsbana~> ~<II~>.\n\n20. No gap indicated in the manuscript; some editors combine the stanza with the fragmentary stanza 21, and others fill in with \"And home will carry | Hogni's daughter.\"]",

The manuscript has only lines 1 and 4 with the word \"first\" of line 2, and does not indicate Helgi as the speaker. The ~<Volsungasaga~>, which follows this poem pretty closely, expands Helgi's speech, and lines 2-3 are conjectural versifications of the saga's prose. ~<Isung~>: nothing is known of him beyond the fact, here indicated, that Hothbrodd killed him.\n\n22. ~<Water's~> ~<gleam~>: gold.\n\n23. ~<Brandey~> (\"Brand-Isle\"): not mentioned elsewhere. ~<Hethinsey~> (\"Hethin's Isle\"): possibly the island of Hiddensee, east of Rügen.]",
					
					"24. Soon off Stafnsnes | stood the ships,\nFair they glided | and gay with gold;\nThen Helgi spake | to Hjorleif asking:\n\"Hast thou counted | the gallant host?\"\n\n25.

The ship's-tents soon | the chieftain struck,\nAnd waked the throng | of warriors all;\n\n[24. ~<Stafnsnes~> (\"Steersman's Cape\"): an unidentifiable promontory. ~<Fair~>: a guess, as the adjective in the manuscript is obscure. ~<Hjorleif~> does not appear elsewhere, and seems to be simply one of Helgi's lieutenants.\n\n25. ~<Tronueyr~>: \"Crane-Strand.\" ~<Long-stemmed~>: literally \"long-headed,\" as the high, curving stem of a Norse ship was often carved to represent a head and neck. ~<Orvasund~>: almost certainly the Danish Öresund, off Seeland. Such bits of geography as this followed Helgi persistently.\n\n26. No gap indicated in the manuscript. ~<Hotun~>: cf. stanza 8 and note.\n\n27. Line 3 seems to have been interpolated from line 4 of ~<Helgakvitha~> ~<Hundingsbana~> II, 42. ~<Ship's-tents~>: the awnings spread over the deck to shelter the crews from sun and rain when the ships were at anchor. ~<Varinsfjord~>: cf. ~<Helgakvitha~> ~<Hjorvarthssonar~>, 22 and note.]",
					
					"(The heroes the red | of dawn beheld;)\nAnd on the masts | the gallant men\nMade fast the sails | in Varinsfjord.\n\n28.

The manuscript indicates line 3 as the beginning of a new stanza, and some editions follow this arrangement, making lines 1-2 a separate stanza.\n\n29. The manuscript indicates no gap, and some editions combine the stanza with lines 3-4 of stanza 28. ~<Sisters~> ~<of~> ~<Kolga~>: the waves, Kolga (\"The Gold\") being one of the daughters of the sea-god, Ægir. As the ~<Volsungasaga~> says, \"Now there was a great storm.\"\n\n30. Helgi demonstrates his courage, whatever one may think of his seamanship. ~<Ægir's~> ~<daughters~>: the waves; cf. stanza 29 and note.]",
					
					"Mightily came | from the claws of Ron\nThe leader's sea-beast | off Gnipalund.\n\n32. At evening there | in Unavagar\nFloated the fleet | bedecked full fair;\nBut they who saw | from Svarin's hill,\nBitter at heart | the host beheld.\n\n33. Then Gothmund asked, | goodly of birth,\n. . . . . . . . . .\n\"Who is the monarch | who guides the host,\nAnd to the land | the warriors leads?\"\n\n34. Sinfjotli answered, | and up on an oar\nRaised a shield all red | with golden rim;\n\n[31. Sigrun here appears again as a Valkyrie. ~<Ron~>: Ægir's wife; cf. ~<Helgakvitha~> ~<Hjorvarthssonar~>, 18 and note. ~<Sea-beast~>: ship. ~<Gnipalund~>: \"Crag-Wood.\"\n\n32. ~<Unavagar~>: \"Friendly Waves.\" ~<Svarin's~> ~<hill~>: the hill where Granmar had his dwelling.\n\n33. Here begins the long dialogue between Gothmund, one of Gramnar's sons, and Sinfjotli, Helgi's half-brother. Two lines (stanza 33, lines 3-4) are quoted by the annotator in the prose note following stanza 16 of the second Helgi Hundingsbane lay, and the dialogue, in much abbreviated form, together with Helgi's admonition to Sinfjotli to cease talking, is closely paralleled in stanzas 22-27 of that poem. It has been suggested that this whole passage (stanzas 33-48) is an interpolation, perhaps from \"the Old Volsung lay.\" This may be, but it seems more probable that the poet used an older poem simply as the basis for this passage, borrowing a little but making up a great deal more. The manuscript indicates no gap in stanza 33.\n\n34. ~<Sinfjotli~>: cf. note on stanza 6. ~<Red~>: raising a red shield was the signal for war.]",
					
					"A sea-sentry was he, | skilled to speak,\nAnd in words with princes | well to strive.\n\n35. \"Say tonight | when you feed the swine,\nAnd send your bitches | to seek their swill,\nThat out of the East | have the Ylfings come,\nGreedy for battle, | to Gnipalund.\n\n36. \"There will Hothbrodd | Helgi find,\nIn the midst of the fleet, | and flight he scorns;\nOften has he | the eagles gorged,\nWhilst thou at the quern | wert slave-girls kissing.\"\n\n~<Gothmund spake:~>\n37. \"Hero, the ancient | sayings heed,\nAnd bring not lies | to the nobly born.\n. . . . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . . . .\n\n38. \"Thou hast eaten | the entrails of wolves,\nAnd of thy brothers | the slayer been;\nOft wounds to suck | thy cold mouth sought,\nAnd loathed in rocky | dens didst lurk.\"\n\n[35. ~<Ylfings~>: cf. stanza 5 and note.\n\n36. ~<Quern~>: turning the hand mill was, throughout antiquity, the task of slaves.\n\n37. The manuscript does not name the speakers in this dialogue. No gap indicated in the manuscript, and editors have attempted various combinations of stanzas 37 and 38.\n\n38. ~<Wolves~>: the Volsungasaga tells that Sigmund and Sinfjotli lived in the woods for a time as werewolves. ~<Brothers~>:]",

The manuscript marks line 3 as the beginning of a new stanza.\n\n39. ~<Varin's~> ~<isle~>: cf. stanza 27 and note, and ~<Helgakvitha~> ~<Hjorvarthssonar~>, 22. Reproaching a man with having been a woman and borne children was not uncommon.\n\n40. This stanza may be an interpolation in the dialogue passage. ~<Allfather~>: Othin. We have no information regarding Gothmund's career, but it looks as though Sinfjotli were drawing solely on his imagination for his taunts, whereas Gothmund's insults have a basis in Sinfjotli's previous life.\n\n41. No gap indicated in the manuscript; some editors combine the two lines with stanza 40, some regard them as the first instead of the last lines of a separate stanza, and some assume the lacuna here indicated. ~<Sogunes~> (\"Saga's Cape\"): of the goddess Saga little is known; cf. ~<Grimnismol~>, 7.]",

The phrase \"under houses,\" which follows the manuscript, may be an error for \"in wolf-caves.\" Line 3 (or 4) may be an interpolation. The manuscript indicates line 5 as the beginning of a new stanza. ~<Siggeir~>: cf. stanza 38, note.\n\n44. Several editions assign this stanza to Sinfjotli instead of to Gothmund. ~<Bravoll~> (\"Field of the Brow\"): not elsewhere mentioned in the poems. ~<Grani~>: Sigurth's horse (cf. ~<Völundarkvitha~>, 16 and note); Gothmund means that Sinfjotli had turned into a mare, after the fashion of Loki (cf. ~<Grimnismol~>, 44, note). The meaning of line 4 in the original is uncertain.\n\n45. A few editions give this stanza to Gothmund. ~<Gollnir~>:]",

Many editors combine lines 5-6 with all or part of stanza 52. Possibly Gothmund is not the speaker. ~<Mast-ring~> ~<harts~>: ships, so called from the ring attaching the yard to the mast. ~<Ylfings~>: cf. stanza 5 and note. ~<Sogn~>: this name, which actually belongs in western Norway, seems to have been used here with no particular significance.\n\n52. The manuscript indicates line 3 as beginning a new stanza; some editors combine lines 3-4 with all or part of stanza]",

The Norse ships of war, as distinguished from merchant vessels, were often called dragons because of their shape and the carving of their stems.\n\n53. The manuscript does not indicate the speaker, and a few editors assume the loss of one or two lines embodying the phrase \"Hothbrodd spake.\" In the manuscript line 3, which many editors have suspected of being spurious, stands before line 2. Possibly lines 4-5 are the remains of a separate stanza. ~<Reginthing~> (\"The Great Council\"): apparently the council-place for the whole country, as distinct from the local council, or \"herathsthing.\" ~<Melnir~> (\"Bit-Bearer\"), ~<Mylnir~> (\"The Biter\") and ~<Spornvitnir~> {~<sic:~> ~<Sporvitnir~> ~<above~>} (\"Spur-Wolf\"): horses' names. ~<Myrkwood~>: a not uncommon name for a dark forest; cf. ~<Lokasenna~>, 42, and ~<Atlakvitha~>, 3. ~<Sparinsheith~> (\"Sparin's Heath\"): nothing more is known of Sparin or his heath. ~<Flame~> ~<of~> ~<wounds~>: sword.\n\n54. ~<Hogni~>: the father of Sigrun; cf. ~<Helgakvitha~> ~<Hundingsbana~>]",

The manuscript indicates line 5 as the beginning of a new stanza, but many editors have rejected lines 5-6 as spurious, while others regard them as the first half of a stanza the last two lines of which have been lost.\n\n56. ~<Wound-givers~>: probably this means \"Valkyries,\" but there is considerable doubt as to the original word. ~<Horse~>, etc.: i.e., the wolf (because giantesses customarily had wolves for their steeds) ate corpses (the food of birds of prey).\n\n57. ~<Yngvi~>: one of the sons of Halfdan the Old, and traditional ancestor of the Ynglings, with whom the Ylfings seem to have been confused (cf. ~<Hynduljoth~>, {sic} 11 and note).

Gering identifies the name of Yngvi with the god Freyr, but the Volsungs certainly claimed descent from Othin, not Freyr, and there is nothing to indicate that Helgi in the Danish tradition was supposed to be descended from Freyr, whereas his descent from Yngvi Halfdansson fits well with the rest of his story. However, cf. ~<Sigurtharkvitha~> ~<en~> ~<skamma~>, 24 and note.\n\n58. This entire stanza may be an interpolation; nearly every edition has a different way of dealing with it. ~<Hringstathir~>: as this place had been given to Helgi by his father (cf. stanza 8 and note), the poet has apparently made a mistake in naming it here as a conquest from Granmar's sons, unless, indeed, they had previously captured it from Helgi, which seems unlikely.]"

The second Helgi Hundingsbane lay is in most respects the exact opposite of the first one: it is in no sense consecutive; it is not a narrative poem, and all or most of it gives evidence of relatively early composition, its origin probably going well back into the tenth century.\n\nIt is frankly nothing but a piece of, in the main, very clumsy patchwork, made up of eight distinct fragments, pieced together awkwardly by the annotator with copious prose notes. One of these fragments (stanzas 13-16) is specifically identified as coming from \"the old Volsung lay.\" What was that poem, and how much more of the extant Helgi-lay compilation was taken from it, and did the annotator know more of it than he included in his patchwork? Conclusive answers to these questions have baffled scholarship, and probably always will do so. My own guess is that the annotator knew little or nothing more than he wrote down; having got the first Helgi Hundingsbane lay, which was obviously in fairly good shape, out of the way, he proceeded to assemble all the odds and ends of verse about Helgi which he could get hold of, putting them together on the basis of the narrative told in the first Helgi lay and of such stories as his knowledge of prose sagas may have yielded.\n\nSection I (stanzas 1-4) deals with an early adventure of Helgi's, -in which he narrowly escapes capture when he ventures into Hunding's home in disguise. Section II (stanzas 5-12) is a dialogue between Helgi and Sigrun at their first meeting. Section III (stanzas 13-16, the \"old Volsung lay\" group) is another dialogue between Helgi and Sigrun when she invokes his aid to save her from Hothbrodd. Section IV (stanzas 17-20, which may well be from the same poem as Section III, is made up of speeches by Helgi and Sigrun after the battle in which Hothbrodd is killed; stanza 21, however, is certainly an interpolation from another poem, as it is in a different meter. Section V (stanzas 22-27) is the dispute between Sinfjotli and Gothmund, evidently",
					
					"in an older form than the one included in the first Helgi Hundingsbane lay. Section VI (stanzas 28-37) gives Dag's speech to his sister, Sigrun, telling of Helgi's death, her curse on her brother and her lament for her slain husband. Section VII (stanza 38) is the remnant of a dispute between Helgi and Hunding, here inserted absurdly out of place. Section VIII (stanzas 39-50) deals with the return of the dead Helgi and Sigrun's visit to him in the burial hill.\n\nSijmons maintains that sections I and II are fragments of the Kara lay mentioned by the annotator in his concluding prose note, and that sections IV, VI, and VIII are from a lost Helgi-Sigrun poem, while Section III comes, of course, from the \"old Volsung lay.\" This seems as good a guess as any other, conclusive proof being quite out of the question.\n\nWere it not for sections, VI and VIII the poem would be little more than a battle-ground for scholars, but those two sections are in many ways as fine as anything in Old Norse poetry. Sigrun's curse of her brother for the slaying of Helgi and her lament for her dead husband, and the extraordinary vividness of the final scene in the burial hill, have a quality which fully offsets the baffling confusion of the rest of the poem.\n\n__________________\n\nKing Sigmund, the son of Volsung, had as wife Borghild, from Bralund. They named their son Helgi, after Helgi Hjorvarthsson; Hagal was Helgi's foster-father. Hunding was the name of a powerful king, and Hundland is named from him. He was a mighty warrior, and had many sons with him on his campaigns. There was enmity and strife between these two, King Hunding and\n\n[~<Prose~>.

					"King Sigmund, and each slew the other's kinsmen. King Sigmund and his family were called Volsungs and Ylfings. Helgi went as a spy to the home of King Hunding in disguise. Hæming, a son of King Hunding's, was at home. When Helgi went forth, then he met a young herdsman, and said:\n\n1. \"Say to Hæming | that Helgi knows\nWhom the heroes | in armor hid;\nA gray wolf had they | within their hall,\nWhom King Hunding | Hamal thought.\"\n\nHamal was the name of Hagal's son. King Hunding\n\n[was named after Helgi Hjorvarthsson is a naive way of getting around the difficulties created by the two sets of Helgi stories. He might equally well have said that the new Helgi was the old one born again, as he accounts for Sigrun in this way (\"she was Svava reborn\"). ~<Hagal~>: not elsewhere mentioned; it was a common custom to have boys brought up by foster-parents. ~<Hunding~> and ~<Hundland~>: cf. ~<Helgakvitha~> ~<Hundingsbana~> ~<I~>, 10 and note. ~<Volsungs~> and ~<Ylfings~>: regarding this confusion of family names cf. ~<Helgakvitha~> ~<Hundingsbana~> ~<I~>, 5 and note. ~<Hæming~>: his name does not appear in the list of Hunding's sons. It is quite possible that these opening stanzas (1-4) do not refer to Hunding at all.\n\n1. Helgi appears to have stayed with Hunding under the name of Hamal, but now, thinking himself safe, he sends word of who he really is. ~<Hunding~>: it has been suggested that the compiler may have inserted this name to fit what he thought the story ought to be, in place of Hæming, or even Hadding. If stanzas 1-4 are a fragment of the ~<Karuljoth~> (~<Lay~> ~<of~> ~<Kara~>), this latter suggestion is quite reasonable, for in that poem, which we do not possess, but which supplied material for the compilers of the ~<Hromundar~> ~<saga~> ~<Greipssonar~>, Helgi appears as Helgi Haddingjaskati (cf. final prose note). Nothing beyond this one name connects stanzas 1-4 with Hunding.]",

The manuscript marks line 3 as the beginning of a stanza. ~<Barley~>: the word literally means \"foreign grain,\" and would afford an interesting study to students of early commerce.\n\n4. Possibly two stanzas with one line lost, or perhaps the lines in parenthesis are spurious; each editor has his own guess, Sigar and Hogni: it seems unlikely that Hagal refers to the Hogni who was Sigrun's father, for this part of the story has nothing whatever to do with Sigrun.

There is nothing in stanzas 5-12 which clearly identifies Sigrun as a Valkyrie, or which, except for the last line of stanza 12, identifies the speaker as Sigrun. Some editors, therefore, call her simply \"the Valkyrie,\" while]",

He had many sons; one was named Hothbrodd, another Gothmund, a third Starkath. Hothbrodd was in a kings' meeting, and he won the promise of having Sigrun, Hogni's daughter, for his wife. But when she heard this, she rode with the Valkyries over air and sea to seek Helgi. Helgi was then at Logafjoll, and had fought with Hunding's sons; there he killed Alf and Eyolf, Hjorvarth and Hervarth. He was all weary with battle, and sat under the eagle-stone. There Sigrun found him, and ran to throw her arms about his neck, and kissed him, and told him her tidings, as is set forth in the old Volsung lay:\n\n13. Sigrun the joyful | chieftain sought,\nForthwith Helgi's | hand she took;\n\n[note on prose following stanza 4), changes Hogni to Halfdan, father of Kara.\n\n~<Prose~>. The manuscript indicates no division. Most of this prose passage is evidently based on ~<Helgakvitha~> ~<Hundingsbana~> ~<I~>; the only new features are the introduction of Starkath as a third son of Granmar, which is clearly an error based on a misunderstanding of stanza 19, and the reference to the ~<kings'~> ~<meeting~>, based on stanza 15. Kings' meetings, or councils, were by no means unusual; the North in early days was prolific in kings. For the remaining names, cf. ~<Helgakvitha~> ~<Hundingsbana~> ~<I~>:]",

					"~<(IV)~>\n\nHelgi then assembled a great sea-host and went to Frekastein. On the sea he met a perilous storm; lightning flashed overhead and the bolts struck the ship. They saw in the air that nine Valkyries were riding, and recognized Sigrun among them. Then the storm abated, and they came safe and sound to land. Granmar's sons sat on a certain mountain as the ships sailed toward the land. Gothmund leaped on a horse and rode for news to a promontory near the harbor; the Volsungs were even then lowering their sails. Then Gothmund said, as is written before in the Helgi lay:\n\n\"Who is the king | who captains the fleet,\nAnd to the land | the warriors leads?\"\n\nSinfjotli, Sigmund's son, answered him, and that too is written. Gothmund rode home with his tidings of the host;\n\n[~<Hundingsbana~> ~<I~>, which he specifically mentions and even quotes. The only new features are the names of Hogni's sons, ~<Bragi~> and ~<Dag~>. Bragi is mentioned in stanza 19, though it is not there stated that he is Hogni's son. Dag, who figures largely in stanzas 28-34, is a puzzle, for the verse never names him, and it is an open question where the annotator got his name. ~<Frekastein~>: cf. ~<Helgakvitha~> ~<Hjorvarthssonar~>, 39 and note. As is written: the two lines are quoted, with a change of two words, from ~<Helgakvitha~> ~<Hundingsbana~> ~<I~>, 33. ~<Sinfjotli~>: cf. ~<Helgakvitha~> ~<Hundingsbana~> ~<I~>, 6 and note, and stanzas 33-48, in which the whole dialogue is given. ~<Loyalty~>: apparently the annotator got this bit of information out of stanza 29, in which Sigrun refers to the oaths which her brother had sworn to Helgi.]",
					
					"then Granmar's sons summoned an army. Many kings came there; there were Hogni, Sigrun's father, and his sons Bragi and Dag. There was a great battle, and all Granmar's sons were slain and all their allies; only Dag, Hogni's son, was spared, and he swore loyalty to the Volsungs. Sigrun went among the dead and found Hothbrodd at the coming of death. She said:\n\n17. \"Never shall Sigrun | from Sevafjoll,\nHothbrodd king, | be held in thine arms;\nGranmar's sons | full cold have grown,\nAnd the giant-steeds gray | on corpses gorge.\"\n\nThen she sought out Helgi, and was full of joy He said:\n\n18. \"Maid, not fair | is all thy fortune,\nThe Norris I blame | that this should be;\nThis morn there fell | at Frekastein\nBragi and Hogni | beneath my hand.\n\n19. \"At Hlebjorg fell | the sons of Hrollaug,\nStarkath the king | at Styrkleifar;\n\n[17. ~<Sevafjoll~> (\"Wet Mountain\"): mentioned only in this poem. ~<Giant-steeds~>: wolves, the usual steeds of giantesses; cf. ~<Helgakvitha~> ~<Hundingsbana~> ~<I~>, 56.\n\n18. ~<Maid~>: the word thus rendered is the same doubtful one which appears in ~<Völundarkvitha~>, 1 and 5, and which may mean specifically a Valkyrie (Gering translates it \"helmed\" or \"heroic\") or simply \"wise.\" Cf. ~<Völundarkvitha~>, note on introductory prose. ~<Norns~>: cf. ~<Voluspo~>, 20 and note.

In the manuscript line 2, indicated as the beginning of a stanza, precedes line 1. ~<Hlebjorg~> (\"Sea-Mountain\") and ~<Styrkleifar~> (\"Battle-Cliffs\"): place names not elsewhere mentioned. Of ~<Hrollaug's~> ~<sons~> nothing further is known. ~<Starkath~>: this name gives a hint of the origin of this stanza, for Saxo Grammaticus tells of the slaying of the Swedish hero Starkath (\"The Strong\") the son of Storverk, and describes how his severed head bit the ground in anger (cf. line 4). In all probability this stanza is from an entirely different poem, dealing with the Starkath story, and the annotator's attempt to identify the Swedish hero as a third son of Granmar is quite without foundation.\n\n21. The difference of meter would of itself be enough to indicate that this stanza comes from an entirely different poem. A few editions assign the whole stanza to Helgi, but lines 3-4. are almost certainly Sigrun's, and the manuscript begins line 3 with a large capital letter following a period.]",
					
					"~<(V)~>\n\nThis Gothmund the son of Granmar spoke:\n\n22. \"What hero great | is guiding the ships?\nA golden flag | on the stem he flies;\nI find not peace in | the van of your faring,\nAnd round the fighters | is battle-light red.\"\n\n~<Sinfjotli spake:~>\n23. \"Here may Hothbrodd | Helgi find,\nThe hater of flight, | in the midst of the fleet;\nThe home of all | thy race he has,\nAnd over the realm | of the fishes he rules.\"\n\n[22. With this stanza begins the dispute between Gothmund and Sinfjotli which, together with Helgi's rebuke to his half brother, appears at much greater length in ~<Helgakvitha~> ~<Hundingsbana~> I, 33-48. It is introduced here manifestly in the wrong place. The version here given is almost certainly the older of the two, but the resemblance is so striking, and in some cases (notably in Helgi's rebuke) the stanzas are so nearly identical, that it seems probable that the composer of the first Helgi Hundingsbane lay borrowed directly from the poem of which the present dialogue is a fragment. Flag: the banner (\"gunnfani,\" cf. \"gonfalon\") here serves as the signal for war instead of the red shield mentioned in ~<Helgakvitha~> ~<Hundingsbana~> I, 34. ~<Battle-light~>: perhaps the \"northern lights.\"\n\n23. Lines 3-4 are obscure, and in the manuscript show signs of error. Helgi had not at this time, so far as we know, conquered any of Hothbrodd's land. ~<The~> ~<realm~> ~<of~> ~<the~> ~<fishes~>, in line 4, presumably means the sea, but the word here translated \"fishes\" is obscure, and many editors treat it as a proper name, \"the realm of the Fjorsungs,\" but without further suggestion as to who or what the Fjorsungs are.]",

The word here translated ~<swords~> is a conjectural emendation; the manuscript implies merely an invitation to continue the quarrel at Frekastein. ~<Hothbrodd~>: apparently he is here considered as present during the dispute; some editors, in defiance of the meter, have emended the line to mean \"Time is it for Hothbrodd | vengeance to have.\"\n\n26-27. Cf. ~<Helgakvitha~> ~<Hundingsbana~> I, 47-48, which are nearly identical.

As this makes the third recorded death of Helgi (once at the hands of Alf, once at those of Dag, and finally in the fight with Hromund), the phenomenon of his rebirth is not surprising. The points of resemblance in all the Helgi stories, including the one told in the lost ~<Karuljoth~>, are sufficiently striking so that it is impossible not to see in them a common origin, and not to believe that Helgi the son of Hjorvarth, Helgi the son of Sigmund and Helgi the Haddings'-Hero (not to mention various other Helgis who probably figured in songs and stories now lost) were all originally the same Helgi who appears in the early traditions of Denmark.]"

					"~<Fra Dautha Sinfjotla~>\n\n~<Of Sinfjotli's Death~>\n\n~<Introductory Note~>\n\nIt has been pointed out that the Helgi tradition, coming originally from Denmark, was early associated with that of the Volsungs, which was of German, or rather of Frankish, origin (cf. Introductory Note to ~<Helgakvitha~> ~<Hjorvarthssonar~>). The connecting links between these two sets of stories were few in number, the main point being the identification of Helgi as a son of Sigmund Volsungsson. Another son of Sigmund, however, appears in the Helgi poems, though not in any of the poems dealing with the Volsung cycle proper. This is Sinfjotli, whose sole function in the extant Helgi lays is to have a wordy dispute with Gothmund Granmarsson.\n\nSinfjotli's history is told in detail in the early chapters of the ~<Volsungasaga~>. The twin sister of Sigmund Volsungsson, Signy, had married Siggeir, who hated his brother-in-law by reason of his desire to possess a sword which had belonged to Othin and been won by Sigmund. Having treacherously invited Volsung and his ten sons to visit him, Siggeir slew Volsung and captured his sons, who were set in the stocks. Each night a wolf (\"some men say that she was Siggeir's mother\") came out of the woods and ate up one of the brothers, till on the tenth night Sigmund alone was left. Then, however, Signy aided him to escape, and incidentally to kill the wolf. He vowed vengeance on Siggeir, and Signy, who hated her husband, was determined to help him. Convinced that Sigmund must have a helper of his own race, Signy changed forms with a witch, and in this guise sought out Sigmund, who, not knowing who she was, spent three nights with her. Thereafter she gave birth to a boy, whom she named Sinfjotli (\"The Yellow-Spotted\"?), whom she sent to Sigmund. For a time they lived in the woods, occasionally turning into wolves (whence perhaps Sinfjotli's name). When Sinfjotli was full grown, he and his father came to Siggeir's house, but were seen and betrayed by the two young sons of Signy and Siggeir, whereupon Sinfjotli slew them. Siggeir promptly had Sigmund and Sinfjotli buried alive, but Signy managed to smuggle Sigmund's famous sword into the grave, and with this the father and son dug themselves out. The next night they burned Siggeir's",
					
					"house, their enemy dying in the flames, and Signy, who had at the last refused to leave her husband, from a sense of somewhat belated loyalty, perishing with him.\n\nWas this story, which the Volsungasaga relates in considerable detail, the basis of an old poem which has been lost? Almost certainly it was, although, as I have pointed out, many if not most of the old stories appear to have been handed down rather in prose than in verse, for the Volsungasaga quotes two lines of verse regarding the escape from the grave. At any rate, Sinfjotli early became a part of the Volsung tradition, which, in turn, formed the basis for no less than fifteen poems generally included in the Eddic collection. Of this tradition we may recognize three distinct parts: the Volsung-Sigmund-Sinfjotli story; the Helgi story, and the Sigurth story, the last of these three being by far the most extensive, and suggesting an almost limitless amount of further subdivision. With the Volsung-Sigmund-Sinfjotli story the Sigurth legend is connected only by the fact that Sigurth appears as Sigmund's son by his last wife, Hjordis; with the Helgi legend it is not connected directly at all. Aside from the fact that Helgi appears as Sigmund's son by his first wife, Borghild, the only link between the Volsung story proper and that of Helgi is the appearance of Sinfjotli in two of the Helgi poems. Originally it is altogether probable that the three stories, or sets of stories, were entirely distinct, and that Sigurth (the familiar Siegfried) had little or nothing more to do with the Volsungs of northern mythological-heroic tradition than he had with Helgi.\n\nThe annotator or compiler of the collection of poems preserved in the ~<Codex~> ~<Regius~>, having finished with the Helgi lays, had before him the task of setting down the fifteen complete or fragmentary poems dealing with the Sigurth story. Before doing this, however, he felt it incumbent on him to dispose of both Sigmund and Sinfjotli, the sole links with the two other sets of stories. He apparently knew of no poem or poems concerning the deaths of these two; perhaps there were none, though this is unlikely. Certainly the story of how Sinfjotli and Sigmund died was current in oral prose tradition, and this story the compiler set forth in the short prose passage entitled ~<Of~> ~<Sinfjotli's~> ~<Death~> which, in ~<Regius~>, immediately follows the second lay of Helgi Hundingsbane. The relation of this passage to the prose of the ~<Reginsmol~> is discussed in the introductory note to that poem.",
					
					"Sigmund, the son of Volsung, was a king in the land of the Franks; Sinfjotli was his eldest son, the second was Helgi, and the third Hamund. Borghild, Sigmund's wife, had a brother who was named -----. Sinfjotli, her stepson, and ----- both wooed the same woman, wherefore Sinfjotli slew him. And when he came home, Borghild bade him depart, but Sigmund offered her atonement-money, and this she had to accept. At the funeral feast Borghild brought in ale; she took poison, a great horn full, and brought it to Sinfjotli. But when he looked into the horn, he saw that it was poison, and said to Sigmund: \"Muddy is the drink, Father!\" Sigmund took the horn and drank therefrom. It is said that Sigmund was so hardy that poison might not harm him, either outside or in, but all his sons could withstand poison only without on their skin. Borghild bore another horn to Sinfjotli and bade him drink, and all happened as before. And yet a third time she brought him a horn, and spoke therewith scornful\n\n[~<Prose~>. Regarding ~<Sigmund~>, ~<Sinfjotli~>, and ~<Volsung~> see Introductory Note. ~<The~> ~<Franks~>: although the Sigurth story had reached the North as early as the sixth or seventh century, it never lost all the marks of its Frankish origin. ~<Helgi~> and ~<Hamund~>: sons of Sigmund and Borghild; Helgi is, of course Helgi Hundingsbane; of Hamund nothing further is. recorded. ~<Borghild~>: the manuscript leaves a blank for the name of her brother; evidently the compiler hoped some day to discover it and write it in, but never did. A few editions insert wholly unauthorized names from late paper manuscripts, such as Hroar, Gunnar, or Borgar. In the ~<Volsungasaga> Borghild bids Sinfjotli drink \"if he has the courage of a Volsung.\" Sigmund gives his advice because \"the king was very drunk, and that was why he spoke thus.\" Gering, on the other hand, gives Sigmund credit for having believed that the draught would deposit its poisonous]",
					
					"words of him if he should not drink from it. He spoke as before with Sigmund. The latter said: \"Let it trickle through your beard, Son!\" Sinfjotli drank, and straight way was dead. Sigmund bore him a long way in his arms, and came to a narrow and long fjord, and there was a little boat and a man in it. He offered to take Sigmund across the fjord. But when Sigmund had borne the corpse out into the boat, then the craft was full. The man told Sigmund to go round the inner end of the fjord. Then the man pushed the boat off, and disappeared.\n\nKing Sigmund dwelt long in Denmark in Borghild's kingdom after he had married her. Thereafter Sigmund went south into the land of the Franks, to the kingdom which he had there. There he married Hjordis, the daughter of King Eylimi; their son was Sigurth. King Sigmund fell in a battle with the sons of Hunding, and Hjordis then married Alf the son of King Hjalprek. There Sigurth grew up in his boyhood. Sigmund and all his sons were far above all other men in might and stature and courage and every kind of ability. Sigurth, however, was the fore most of all, and all men call him in the old tales the noblest of mankind and the mightiest leader.\n\n[contents in Sinfjotli's beard, and thus do him no harm. ~<Boat~>: the man who thus carries off the dead Sinfjotli in his boat is presumably Othin. ~<Denmark~>: Borghild belongs to the Danish Helgi part of the story. The Franks: with this the Danish and Norse stories of Helgi and Sinfjotli come to an end, and the Frankish story of Sigurth begins. Sigmund's two kingdoms are an echo of the blended traditions. ~<Hjordis~>: just where this name came from is not clear, for in the German story Siegfried's mother is Sigelint, but the name of the father of Hjordis, Eylimi, gives a clew, for Eylimi is the father of Svava, wife of Helgi Hjorvarthsson.]",
					
					"[Doubtless the two men are not identical, but it seems likely that both Eylimi and Hjordis were introduced into the Sigmund-Sigurth story, the latter replacing Sigelint, from some version of the Helgi tradition. ~<Hunding~>: in the Helgi lays the sons of Hunding are all killed, but they reappear here and in two of the poems (~<Gripisspo~>, 9, and ~<Reginsmol~>, 15), and the ~<Volsungasaga~> names Lyngvi as the son of Hunding who, as the rejected lover of Hjordis, kills Sigmund and his father-in-law, Eylimi, as well. The episode of Hunding and his sons belongs entirely to the Danish (Helgi) part of the story; the German legend knows nothing of it, and permits the elderly Sigmund to outlive his son. There was doubtless a poem on this battle, for the Volsungasaga quotes two lines spoken by the dying Sigmund to Hjordis before he tells her to give the pieces of his broken sword to their unborn son. ~<Alf~>: after the battle, according to the Volsungasaga, Lyngvi Hundingsson tried to capture Hjordis, but she was rescued by the sea-rover Alf, son of King Hjalprek of Denmark, who subsequently married her. Here is another trace of the Danish Helgi tradition. The ~<Nornageststhattr~> briefly tells the same story.]"

					"~<Gripisspo~> - ~<Gripir's Prophecy~>\n\n~<Introductory Note~>\n\nThe Gripisspo immediately follows the prose ~<Fra~> ~<Dautha~> ~<Sinfjotla~> in the ~<Codex~> ~<Regius~>, and is contained in no other early manuscript. It is unquestionably one of the latest of the poems in the Eddic collection; most critics agree in calling it the latest of all, dating it not much before the year 1200. Its author (for in this instance the word may be correctly used) was not only familiar with the other poems of the Sigurth cycle, but seems to have had actual written copies of them before him; it has, indeed, been suggested, and not without plausibility, that the ~<Gripisspo~> may have been written by the very man who compiled and annotated the collection of poems preserved in the ~<Codex~> ~<Regius~>.\n\nIn form the poem is a dialogue between the youthful Sigurth and his uncle, Gripir, but in substance it is a condensed outline of Sigurth's whole career as told piecemeal in the older poems. The writer was sufficiently skillful in the handling of verse, but he was utterly without inspiration; his characters are devoid of vitality, and their speeches are full of conventional phrases, with little force or incisiveness. At the same time, the poem is of considerable interest as giving, in brief form, a summary of the story of Sigurth as it existed in Iceland (for the ~<Gripisspo~> is almost certainly Icelandic) in the latter half of the twelfth century.\n\nIt is not desirable here to go in detail into the immensely complex question of the origin, growth, and spread of the story of Sigurth (Siegfried). The volume of critical literature on the subject is enormous, and although some of the more patently absurd theories have been eliminated, there are still wide divergencies of opinion regarding many important points. At the same time, a brief review of the chief facts is necessary in order to promote a clearer understanding of the poems which follow, and which make up more than a third of the Eddic collection.\n\nThat the story of Sigurth reached the North from Germany, having previously developed among the Franks of the Rhine country, is now universally recognized. How and when it spread from northwestern Germany into Scandinavia are less certainly known. It spread, indeed, in every direction, so that traces of it",
					
					"are found wherever Frankish influence was extensively felt; but it was clearly better known and more popular in Norway, and in the settlements established by Norwegians, than anywhere else. We have historical proof that there was considerable contact, commercial and otherwise, between the Franks of northwestern Germany and the Norwegians (but not the Swedes or the Danes) throughout the period from 600 to 800; coins of Charlemagne have been found in Norway, and there is other evidence showing a fairly extensive interchange of ideas as well as of goods. Presumably, then, the story of the Frankish hero found its way into Norway in the seventh century. While, at this stage of its development, it may conceivably have included a certain amount of verse, it is altogether probable that the story as it came into Norway in the seventh century was told largely in prose, and that, even after the poets had got hold of it, the legend continued to live among the people in the form of oral prose saga.\n\nThe complete lack of contemporary material makes it impossible for us to speak with certainty regarding the character and content of the Sigurth legend as it existed in the Rhine country in the seventh century. It is, however, important to remember the often overlooked fact that any popular traditional hero became a magnet for originally unrelated stories of every kind. It must also be remembered that in the early Middle Ages there existed no such distinction between fiction and history as we now make; a saga, for instance, might be anything from the most meticulously accurate history to the wildest of fairy tales, and a single saga might (and sometimes did) combine both elements. This was equally true of the Frankish traditions, and the two principles just stated account for most of the puzzling phenomena in the growth of the Sigurth story.\n\nOf the origin of Sigurth himself we know absolutely nothing. No historical analogy can be made to fit in the slightest degree. If one believes in the possibility of resolving hero stories into nature myths, he may be explained in that fashion, but such a solution is not necessary. The fact remains that from very early days Sigurth (Sifrit) was a great traditional hero among the Franks. The tales of his strength and valor, of his winning of a great treasure, of his wooing a more or less supernatural bride, and of his death at the hands of his kinsmen, probably were early features of this legend.\n\nThe next step was the blending of this story with one which",
					
					"had a clear basis in history. In the year 437 the Burgundians, under their king, Gundicarius (so the Latin histories call him), were practically annihilated by the Huns. The story of this great battle soon became one of the foremost of Rhineland traditions; and though Attila was presumably not present in person, he was quite naturally introduced as the famous ruler of the invading hordes. The dramatic story of Attila's death in the year 453 was likewise added to the tradition, and during the sixth century the chain was completed by linking together the stories of Sigurth and those of the Burgundian slaughter. Gundicarius becomes the Gunther of the ~<Nibelungenlied~> and the Gunnar of the Eddic poems; Attila becomes Etzel and Atli. A still further development came through the addition of another, and totally unrelated, set of historical traditions based on the career of Ermanarich, king of the Goths, who died about the year 376. Ermanarich figures largely in many stories unconnected with the Sigurth cycle, but, with the zeal of the medieval story-tellers for connecting their heroes, he was introduced as the husband of Sigurth's daughter, Svanhild, herself originally part of a separate narrative group, and as Jormunrek he plays a considerable part in a few of the Eddic poems.\n\nSuch, briefly, appears to have been the development of the legend before it came into Norway. Here it underwent many changes, though the clear marks of its southern origin were never obliterated. The names were given Scandinavian forms, and in some cases were completely changed (~<e.g.~>, Kriemhild becomes Guthrun). New figures, mostly of secondary importance, were introduced, and a large amount of purely Northern local color was added. Above all, the earlier part of the story was linked with Northern mythology in a way which seems to have had no counterpart among the southern Germanic peoples. The Volsungs become direct descendants of Othin; the gods are closely concerned with Fafnir's treasure, and so on. Above all, the Norse story-tellers and poets changed the figure of Brynhild. In making her a Valkyrie, sleeping on the flame-girt rock, they were never completely successful, as she persisted in remaining, to a considerable extent, the entirely human daughter of Buthli whom Sigurth woos for Gunnar. This confusion, intensified by a mixing of names (cf. ~<Sigrdrifumol~>, introductory note), and much resembling that which existed in the parallel cases of Svava and Sigrun in the Helgi tradition, created difficulties",
					
					"which the Norse poets and story-tellers were never able to smooth out, and which have perplexed commentators ever since.\n\nThose who read the Sigurth poems in the ~<Edda~>, or the story told in the ~<Volsungasaga~>, expecting to find a critically accurate biography of the hero, will, of course, be disappointed. If, how. ever, they will constantly keep in mind the general manner in which the legend grew, its accretions ranging all the way from the Danube to Iceland, they will find that most of the difficulties are simply the natural results of conflicting traditions. just as the Danish Helgi had to be \"reborn\" twice in order to enable three different men to kill him, so the story of Sigurth, as told in the Eddic poems, involves here and there inconsistencies explicable only when the historical development of the story is taken into consideration.\n\n__________________\n\nGripir was the name of Eylimi's son, the brother of Hjordis; he ruled over lands and was of all men the wisest and most forward-seeing. Sigurth once was riding alone and came to Gripir's hall. Sigurth was easy to recognize; he found out in front of the hall a man whose name was Geitir. Then Sigurth questioned him and asked:\n\n1. \"Who is it has | this dwelling here,\nOr what do men call | the people's king?\"\n\n[~<Prose~>.

Introductory Note). The statement that Sigurth is to go direct from the slaying of Fafnir to Gjuki's hall involves one of the confusions resulting from the dual personality of Brynhild. In the older (and the original South Germanic) story, Sigurth becomes a guest of the Gjukungs before he has ever heard of Brynhild, and first sees her when, having changed forms with Gunnar, he goes to woo her for the latter. In an other version he finds Brynhild before he visits the Gjukungs, only to forget her as the result of the magic-draught administered by Guthrun's mother. Both these versions are represented in the poems of which the author of the ~<Gripisspo~> made use, and he tried, rather clumsily, to combine them, by having Sigurth go to Gjuki's house, then find the unnamed Valkyrie, and then return to Gjuki, the false wooing following this second visit.\n\n15. Basing his story on the ~<Sigrdrifumol~>, the poet here tells of Sigurth's finding of the Valkyrie, whom he does not identify with Brynhild, daughter of Buthli (stanza 27), at all. His error in this respect is not surprising, in view of Brynhild's dual identity (cf. Introductory Note, and ~<Fafnismol~>, 44 and note).]",

In the older Norse poems Brynhild is a sister of Atli (Attila), a relationship wholly foreign to the southern stories, and the father of this strangely assorted pair is Buthli, who in the ~<Nibelungenlied~> is apparently Etzel's grandfather.

The ~<Volsungasaga~> tells how Grimhild gave Sigurth a magic draught which made him utterly forget Brynhild. Edzardi thinks two stanzas have been lost after stanza 33, their remains appearing in stanza 37.\n\n35. In the ~<Volsungasaga~> Grimhild merely advises Gunnar to seek Brynhild for his wife, and to have Sigurth ride with him. ~<Goths~>: the historical Gunnar (Gundicarius, cf. Introductory Note) was not a Goth, but a Burgundian, but the word \"Goth\" was applied in the North without much discrimination to the southern Germanic peoples.]",

In the ~<Nibelungenlied~> Siegfried merely makes himself invisible in order to lend Gunther his strength for the feats which must be performed in order to win the redoubtable bride. In the northern version Sigurth and Gunnar change forms, \"as Grimhild had taught them how to do.\" The ~<Volsungasaga~> tells how Sigurth and Gunnar came to Heimir, who told them that to win Brynhild one must ride through the ring of fire which surrounded her hall (cf. the hall of Mengloth in ~<Svipdagsmol~>). Gunnar tries it, but his horse balks; then he mounts Grani, but Grani will not stir for him. So they change forms, and Sigurth rides Grani through the flames. ~<Oaths~>: the blood-brotherhood sworn by Sigurth, Gunnar, and Hogni makes it impossible for the brothers to kill him themselves, but they finally get around the difficulty by inducing their half-brother, Gotthorm (cf. ~<Hyndluljoth~>, 27 and note) to do it.]",

The last half of line 4 is obscure, and the reading is conjectural.\n\n41. Something is clearly wrong with stanzas 41-43. in the manuscript the order is 41, 43, 42, which brings two of Gripir's answers together, followed by two of Sigurth's questions. Some editors have arranged the stanzas as in this translation, while others have interchanged 41 and 43. In any case, Sigurth in stanza 42 asks about the \"three nights\" which Gripir has never mentioned. I suspect that lines 3-4 of stanza 41, which are practically identical with lines 3-4 of stanza 23, got in here by mistake, replacing two lines which may have run thus: \"With thy sword between, | three nights thou sleepest / With her thou winnest | for Gunnar's wife.\" The subsequent poems tell how Sigurth laid his sword Gram between himself and Brynhild.]",
					
					"~<Sigurth spake:~>\n42. \"Shall Gunnar have | a goodly wife,\nFamed among men,-- | speak forth now, Gripir!\nAlthough at my side | three nights she slept,\nThe warrior's bride? | Such ne'er has been.\"\n\n~<Gripir spake:~>\n43. \"The marriage draught | will be drunk for both,\nFor Sigurth and Gunnar, | in Gjuki's hall;\nYour forms ye change, | when home ye fare,\nBut the mind of each | to himself remains.\"\n\n~<Sigurth spake:~>\n44. \"Shall the kinship new | thereafter come\nTo good among us? | Tell me, Gripir!\nTo Gunnar joy | shall it later give,\nOr happiness send | for me myself?\"\n\n~<Gripir spake:~>\n45. \"Thine oaths remembering, | silent thou art,\nAnd dwellest with Guthrun | in wedlock good;\nBut Brynhild shall deem | she is badly mated,\nAnd wiles she seeks, | herself to avenge.\"\n\n[45. The simultaneous weddings of Sigurth and Gunnar form a memorable feature of the German tradition as it appears in the ~<Nibelungenlied~>, but in the ~<Volsungasaga~> Sigurth marries Guthrun before he sets off with Gunnar to win Brynhild.\n\n45. According to the ~<Volsungasaga~>, Sigurth remembers his oaths to Brynhild almost immediately after his return to Gunnar's house. Brynhild, on the other hand, knows nothing until the]",
					
					"~<Sigurth spake:~>\n46. \"What may for the bride | requital be,\nThe wife we won | with subtle wiles?\nFrom me she has | the oaths I made,\nAnd kept not long; | they gladdened her little.\"\n\n~<Gripir spake:~>\n47. \"To Gunnar soon | his bride will say\nThat ill didst thou | thine oath fulfill,\nWhen the goodly king, | the son of Gjuki,\nWith all his heart | the hero trusted.\"\n\n~<Sigurth spake:~>\n48. \"What sayst thou, Gripir? | give me the truth!\nAm I guilty so | as now is said,\n\n[famous quarrel between herself and Guthrun at the bath (an other reminiscence of the German story), when she taunts Guthrun with Sigurth's inferiority to Gunnar, and Guthrun retorts with the statement that it was Sigurth, and not Gunnar, who rode through the flames.\n\n47. Brynhild tells Gunnar that Sigurth really possessed her during the three nights when he slept by her in Gunnar's form, thus violating his oath. Here again there is a confusion of two traditions. If Sigurth did not meet Brynhild until after his oath to Gunnar (cf. note on stanza 13), Brynhild's charge is entirely false, as she herself admits in ~<Helreith~> ~<Brynhildar~>. On the other hand, according to the version in which Sigurth finds Brynhild before he meets Gjuki's sons, their union was not only completed, but she had by him a daughter, Aslaug, whom she leaves in Heimir's charge before going to become Gunnar's wife. This is the ~<Volsungasaga~> version, and thus the statement Brynhild makes to Gunnar, as a result of which Sigurth is slain, is quite true.]",

					"~<Reginsmol~>\n\n~<The Ballad of Regin~>\n\n~<Introductory Note~>\n\nThe ~<Reginsmol~> immediately follows the ~<Gripisspo~> in the ~<Codex~> ~<Regius~>, and in addition stanzas 1, 2, 6, and 18 are quoted in the ~<Volsungasaga~>, and stanzas 11-26 in the ~<Nornageststhattr~>. In no instance is the title of the poem stated, and in ~<Regius~> there stands before the introductory prose, very faintly written, what appears to be \"Of Sigurth.\" As a result, various titles have been affixed to it, the two most often used being \"the Ballad of Regin\" and \"the First Lay of Sigurth Fafnisbane.\"\n\nAs a matter of fact, it is by no means clear that the compiler of the Eddic collection regarded this or either of the two following poems, the ~<Fafnismol~> and the ~<Sigrdrifumol~>, as separate and distinct poems at all. There are no specific titles given, and the prose notes link the three poems in a fairly consecutive whole. Furthermore, the prose passage introducing the ~<Reginsmol~> connects directly with ~<Fra~> ~<Dautha~> ~<Sinfjotla~>, and only the insertion of the ~<Gripisspo~> at this point, which may well have been done by some stupid copyist, breaks the continuity of the story. For convenience I have here followed the usual plan of dividing this material into distinct parts, or poems, but I greatly doubt if this division is logically sound. The compiler seems, rather, to have undertaken to set down the story of Sigurth in consecutive form, making use of all the verse with which he was familiar, and which, by any stretch of the imagination, could be made to fit, filling up the gaps with prose narrative notes based on the living oral tradition.\n\nThis view is supported by the fact that not one of the three poems in question, and least of all the ~<Reginsmol~>, can possibly be regarded as a unit. For one thing, each of them includes both types of stanza commonly used in the Eddic poems, and this, notwithstanding the efforts of Grundtvig and Müllenhoff to prove the contrary, is almost if not quite conclusive proof that each poem consists of material taken from more than one source. Furthermore, there is nowhere continuity within the verse itself for more than a very few stanzas. An analysis of the ~<Reginsmol~> shows that stanzas 1-4, 6-10, and 12, all in Ljothahattr stanza form, seem to belong together as fragments of a poem dealing with",
					
					"Loki's (not Andvari's) curse on the gold taken by the gods from Andvari and paid to Hreithmar, together with Hreithmar's death at the hands of his son, Fafnir, as the first result of this curse. Stanza 5, in Fornyrthislag, is a curse on the gold, here ascribed to Andvari, but the only proper name in the stanza, Gust, is quite unidentifiable, and the stanza may originally have had to do with a totally different story. Stanza 11, likewise in Fornyrthislag, is merely a father's demand that his daughter rear a family to avenge his death; there is nothing in it to link it necessarily with the dying Hreithmar. Stanzas 13-18, all in Fornyrthislag, give Regin's welcome to Sigurth (stanzas 13,14), Sigurth's announcement that he will avenge his father's death on the sons of Hunding before he seeks any treasure (stanza 15), and a dialogue between a certain Hnikar, who is really Othin, and Regin, as the latter and Sigurth are on the point of being shipwrecked. This section (stanzas 13-19) bears a striking resemblance to the Helgi lays, and may well have come originally from that cycle. Next follows a passage in Ljothahattr form (stanzas 19-22 and 24-25) in which Hnikar-Othin gives some general advice as to lucky omens and good conduct in battle; the entire passage might equally well stand in the Hovamol, and I suspect that it originally came from just such a collection of wise saws. Inserted in this passage is stanza 23, in Fornyrthislag, likewise on the conduct of battle, with a bit of tactical advice included. The \"poem\" ends with a single stanza, in Fornyrthislag, simply stating that the bloody fight is over and that Sigurth fought well--a statement equally applicable to any part of the hero's career.\n\nFinnur Jonsson has divided the ~<Reginsmol~> into two poems, or rather into two sets of fragments, but this, as the foregoing analysis has indicated, does not appear to go nearly far enough. It accords much better with the facts to assume that the compiler of the collection represented by the ~<Codex~> ~<Regius~>, having set out to tell the story of Sigurth, took his verse fragments pretty much wherever he happened to find them. In this connection, it should be remembered that in the fluid state of oral tradition poems, fragments, and stanzas passed readily and frequently from one story to another. Tradition, never critical, doubtless connected with the Sigurth story much verse that never originated there.\n\nIf the entire passage beginning with the prose ~<Fra~> ~<Dautha~> ~<Sinfjotla~>, and, except for the ~<Gripisspo~>, including the ~<Reginsmol~>, ~<Fafnismol~>, and ~<Sigrdrifumol~>, be regarded as a highly uncritical",
					
					"piece of compilation, rendered consecutive by the compiler's prose narrative, its difficulties are largely smoothed away; any other way of looking at it results in utterly inconclusive attempts to reconstruct poems some of which quite possibly never existed. The twenty-six stanzas and accompanying prose notes included under the heading of ~<Reginsmol~> belong almost wholly to the northern part of the Sigurth legend; the mythological features have no counterpart in the southern stories, and only here and there is there any betrayal of the tradition's Frankish home. The story of Andvari, Loki, and Hreithmar is purely Norse, as is the concluding section containing Othin's counsels. If we assume that the passage dealing with the victory over Hunding's sons belongs to the Helgi cycle (cf. introductory notes to ~<Helgakvitha~> ~<Hjorvarthssonar~> and ~<Helgakvitha~> ~<Hundingsbana~> ~<I~>), there is very little left to reflect the Sigurth tradition proper.\n\nRegarding the general development of the story of Sigurth in the North, see the introductory note to the ~<Gripisspo~>.\n\n__________________\n\nSigurth went to Hjalprek's stud and chose for himself a horse, who thereafter was called Grani. At that time Regin, the son of Hreithmar, was come to Hjalprek's home; he was more ingenious than all other men, and a dwarf in stature; he was wise, fierce and skilled in magic. Regin undertook Sigurth's bringing up and teaching, and loved him much. He told Sigurth of his forefathers, and also of this: that once Othin and Hönir and Loki had come to Andvari's waterfall, and in the fall were many fish. Andvari was a dwarf, who had dwelt long in the waterfall in the shape of a pike, and there he got his food. \"Otr was the name of a brother of ours,\" said. Regin, \"who often went into the fall in the shape of an otter; he had caught a salmon, and sat on the high bank eating it with his eyes shut. Loki threw a stone at him and killed him; the gods thought they bad had great good luck, and",
					
					"stripped the skin off the otter. That same evening they sought a night's lodging at Hreithmar's house, and showed their booty. Then we seized them, and told them, as ransom for their lives, to fill the otter skin with gold, and completely cover it outside as well with red gold. Then they sent Loki to get the gold; he went to Ron and got her net, and went then to Andvari's fall and cast the net in front of the pike, and the pike leaped into the net.\" Then Loki said:\n\n1. \"What is the fish | that runs in the flood,\nAnd itself from ill cannot save?\nIf thy head thou wouldst | from hell redeem,\nFind me the water's flame.\"\n\n[~<Prose~>. ~<Hjalprek~>: father of Alf, Sigurth's step-father; cf. ~<Fra~> ~<Dautha~> ~<Sinfjotla~>, and note. ~<Grani~>: cf. ~<Gripisspo~>, 5 and note. ~<Regin~> (\"Counsel-Giver\"): undoubtedly he goes back to the smith of the German story; in the ~<Thithrekssaga~> version he is called Mimir, while Regin is there the name of the dragon (here Regin's brother, Fafnir). The ~<Voluspo~> (stanza 12) names a Regin among the dwarfs, and the name may have assisted in making Regin a dwarf here. ~<Hreithmar~>: nothing is known of him outside of this story. Othin, Hönir and Loki: these same three gods appear in company in ~<Voluspo~>, 17-18. Andvari's fall: according to Snorri, who tells this entire story in the ~<Skaldskaparmal~>, Andvari's fall was in the world of the dark elves, while the one when Loki killed the otter was not; here, however, the two are considered identical. ~<With~> ~<his~> ~<eyes~> ~<shut~>: according to Snorri, Otr ate with his eyes shut because be was so greedy that he could not bear to see the food before him diminishing. ~<Ron~>: wife of the sea-god Ægir, who draws down drowning men with her net; cf. ~<Helgakvitha~> ~<Hjorvarthssonar~>, 18 and note. Snorri says that Loki caught the pike with his hands.\n\n1. Snorri quotes this stanza. ~<Water's~> ~<game~>: gold, so called because Ægir, the sea-god, was wont to light his hall with gold.]",

The dwarf went into his rocky hole and said:\n\n5. \"Now shall the gold | that Gust once had\nBring their death | to brothers twain,\nAnd evil be | for heroes eight;\njoy of my wealth | shall no man win.\"\n\nThe gods gave Hreithmar the gold, and filled up the otter-skin, and stood it on its feet. Then the gods had to heap up gold and hide it. And when that was done, Hreithmar came forward and saw a single whisker, and bade them cover it. Then Othin brought out the ring Andvaranaut and covered the hair. Then Loki said:\n\n6. \"The gold is given, | and great the price\nThou hast my head to save;\n\n[5. This stanza apparently comes from a different source from stanzas 1-4 (or 1-2 if 3-4 are interpolated) and 6-10; cf. ~<Introductory~> ~<Note~>. In the ~<Volsungasaga~> Andvari lays his curse particularly on the ring. ~<Gust~>: possibly a name for Andvari himself, or for an earlier possessor of the treasure. ~<Brothers~> ~<twain~>: Fafnir and Regin. ~<Heroes~> ~<eight~>: the word \"eight\" may easily have been substituted for something like \"all\" to make the stanza fit the case; the \"eight\" in question are presumably Sigurth, Gotthorm, Gunnar, Hogni, Atli, Erp, Sorli and Hamther, all of whom are slain in the course of the story. But the stanza may originally not have referred to Andvari's treasure at all.\n\n~<Prose~>. ~<Andvaranaut~>: \"Andvari's Gem.\"\n\n6. Snorri quotes this stanza, introducing it, as here, with \"Then Loki said\" in the prose. ~<Regius~> omits this phrase, but inserts \"said Loki\" in line 1.]",

Apparently, however, the reference is to the fight between Sigurth and the sons of Gjuki over Brynhild.

Thereupon Regin asked to have his inheritance from his father, but Fafnir refused this. Then Regin asked counsel\n\n[10. Hreithmar's daughters do not appear elsewhere. It has been suggested that originally stanza 10 was followed by one in which Lofnheith lamented her inability to avenge her father, as she was married and had no son.\n\n11. Apparently an interpolation (cf. Introductory Note). Vigfusson tries to reconstruct lines 2 and 4 to fit the Ljothahattr rhythm, but without much success. Hreithmar urges his daughter, as she has no sons, to bear a daughter who, in turn, will have a son to avenge his great-grandfather. Grundtvig worked out an ingenious theory to fit this stanza, making Sigurth's grand-father, Eylimi, the husband of Lyngheith's daughter, but there is absolutely no evidence to support this. The stanza may have nothing to do with Hreithmar.]",

Introductory Note). ~<Hardy~> ~<wolf~>: warrior, i. e., Sigurth.\n\n14. ~<Yngvi's~> ~<heir~>: Yngvi was one of the sons of the Danish king Halfdan the Old, and traditionally an ancestor of Helgi (cf. ~<Helgakvitha~> ~<Hundingsbana~> ~<I~>, 57 and note).

Regin made Sigurth the sword which was called Gram; it was so sharp that when he thrust it down into the Rhine, and let a strand of wool drift against it with the stream, it cleft the strand asunder as if it were water. With this sword Sigurth cleft asunder Regin's anvil. After that Regin egged Sigurth on to slay Fafnir, but he said:\n\n15. \"Loud will the sons | of Hunding laugh,\nWho low did Eylimi | lay in death,\nIf the hero sooner | seeks the red\nRings to find | than his father's vengeance.\"\n\nKing Hjalprek gave Sigurth a fleet for the avenging\n\n[a descendant of Yngvi is, of course, absurd, and the use of this phrase is one of the many reasons for believing that stanzas 13-18 belonged originally to the Helgi cycle. ~<The~> ~<threads~>, etc.: another link with Helgi; cf. ~<Helgakvitha~> ~<Hundingsbana~> ~<I~>, 3-4.

					"~<Fafnismol~>\n\n~<The Ballad of Fafnir~>\n\n~<Introductory Note~>\n\nThe so-called ~<Fafnismol~>, contained in full in the ~<Codex~> ~<Regius~>, where it immediately follows the ~<Reginsmol~> without any indication of a break, is quoted by Snorri in the ~<Gylfaginning~> (stanza 13) and the ~<Skaldskaparmal~> (stanzas 32 and 33), and stanzas 6, 3, and 4 appear in the ~<Sverrissaga~>. Although the ~<Volsungasaga~> does not actually quote any of the stanzas, it gives a very close prose parallel to the whole poem in chapters 18 and 19.\n\nThe general character of the ~<Fafnismol~>, and its probable relation to the ~<Reginsmol~> and the ~<Sigrdrifumol~>, have been discussed in the introductory note to the ~<Reginsmol~>. While it is far more nearly a unit than the ~<Reginsmol~>, it shows many of the same characteristics. It has the same mixture of stanza forms, although in this case only nine stanzas (32-33, 35-36 and 40-44) vary from the normal Ljothahattr measure. It shows, though to a much less marked extent, the same tendency to introduce passages from extraneous sources, such as the question-and-answer passage in stanzas 11-15. At the same time, in this instance it is quite clear that one distinct poem, including probably stanzas 1-10, 16-23, 25-31, and 34-39, underlay the compilation which we here have. This may, perhaps, have been a long poem (not, however, the \"Lone' Sigurth Lay; see introductory note to ~<Brot~> ~<af~> ~<Sigurtharkvithu~>) dealing with the Regin-Fafnir-Sigurth-Brynhild story, and including, besides most of the ~<Fafnismol~>, stanzas 1-4 and 6-11 of the ~<Reginsmol~> and part of the so-called ~<Sigrdrifumol~>, together with much that has been lost. The original poem may, on the other hand, have confined itself to the Fafnir episode. In any case, and while the extant ~<Fafnismol~> can be spoken of as a distinct poem far more justly than the ~<Reginsmol~>, there is still no indication that the compiler regarded it as a poem by itself. His prose notes run on without a break, and the verses simply cover a dramatic episode in Sigurth's early life. The fact that the work of compilation has been done more intelligently than in the case of the ~<Reginsmol~> seems to have resulted chiefly from the compiler's having been familiar with longer consecutive verse passages dealing with the Fafnir episode.",
					
					"The ~<Reginsmol~> is little more than a clumsy mosaic, but in the ~<Fafnismol~> it is possible to distinguish between the main substance of the poem and the interpolations.\n\nHere, as in the ~<Reginsmol~>, there is very little that bespeaks the German origin of the Sigurth story. Sigurth's winning of the treasure is in itself undoubtedly a part of the earlier southern legend, but the manner in which he does it is thoroughly Norse. Moreover, the concluding section, which points toward the finding of the sleeping Brynhild, relates entirely to the northern Valkyrie, the warrior-maiden punished by Othin, and not at all to the southern Brynhild the daughter of Buthli. The ~<Fafnismol~> is, however, sharply distinguished from the ~<Reginsmol~> by showing no clear traces of the Helgi tradition, although a part of the bird song (stanzas 40-44, in Fornyrthislag form, as distinct from the body of the poem) sounds suspiciously like the bird passage in the beginning of the ~<Helgakvitha~> ~<Hjorvarthssonar~>. Regarding the general relations of the various sets of traditions in shaping the story of Sigurth, see the introductory note to ~<Gripisspo~>.\n\nThe ~<Fafnismol~>, together with a part of the ~<Sigrdrifumol~>, has indirectly become the best known of all the Eddic poems, for the reason that Wagner used it, with remarkably little change of outline, as the basis for his \"Siegfried.\"\n\n__________________\n\nSigurth and Regin went up to the Gnitaheith, and found there the track that Fafnir made when he crawled to water. Then Sigurth made a great trench across the path, and took his place therein. When Fafnir crawled from his gold, he blew out venom, and it ran down from above on Sigurth's head. But when Fafnir crawled over the trench, then Sigurth thrust his sword into his body\n\n[~<Prose~>. The prose follows the concluding prose passage of the ~<Reginsmol~> without any interruption; the heading \"Of Fafnir's Death\" is written in the manuscript very faintly just before stanza 1. ~<Gnitaheith~>: cf. ~<Gripisspo~>, ii and note. ~<Fafnir~>: Regin's brother: cf. ~<Reginsmol~>, prose after stanza 14. ~<Venom~>: in the ~<Volsungasaga~>]",
					
					"to the heart. Fafnir writhed and struck out with his head and tail. Sigurth leaped from the trench, and each looked at the other. Fafnir said:\n\n1. \"Youth, oh, youth! | of whom then, youth, art thou born?\nSay whose son thou art,\nWho in Fafnir's blood | thy bright blade reddened,\nAnd struck thy sword to my heart.\"\n\nSigurth concealed his name because it was believed in olden times that the word of a dying man might have great power if he cursed his foe by his name. He said:\n\n2. \"The Noble Hart | my name, and I go\nA motherless man abroad;\nFather I had not, | as others have,\nAnd lonely ever I live.\"\n\n[it was the blood, and not the venom, that poured down on Sigurth's head. Sigurth was much worried about this danger, and before he dug the trench asked Regin what would happen if the dragon's blood overcame him. Regin thereupon taunted him with cowardice (Sigurth refers to this taunt in stanza 30, but the stanza embodying it has disappeared). After Sigurth had dug his trench, an old man (Othin, of course) appeared and advised him to dig other trenches to carry off the blood, which he did, thereby escaping harm.\n\n1.

					"Hither o'er mountains high;\nThe glittering worm | would have wealth and life\nIf thou hadst not mocked at my might.\"\n\nThen Regin went up to Fafnir and cut out his heart with his sword, that was named Rithil, and then he drank blood from the wounds. Regin said:\n\n31. \"Sit now, Sigurth, | for sleep will I,\nHold Fafnir's heart to the fire;\nFor all his heart | shall eaten be,\nSince deep of blood I have drunk.\"\n\nSigurth took Fafnir's heart and cooked it on a spit. When he thought that it was fully cooked, and the blood foamed out of the heart, then he tried it with his finger to see whether it was fully cooked. He burned his finger, and put it in his mouth. But when Fafnir's heart's-blood came on his tongue, he understood the speech of birds. He heard nut-hatches chattering in the thickets. A nut hatch said:\n\n32. \"There sits Sigurth, | sprinkled with blood,\nAnd Fafnir's heart | with fire he cooks;\n\n[30. Something has evidently been lost before this stanza. Sigurth clearly refers to Regin's reproach when he was digging the trench (cf. note on introductory prose), but the poem does not give such a passage.\n\n~<Prose~>. ~<Rithil~> (\"Swift-Moving\"): Snorri calls the sword Refil (\"Serpent\").\n\n32.

It is also far from clear how many birds are speaking. The manuscript numbers II, III, and IV in the margin with numerals; the ~<Volsungasaga~> makes a different bird speak each time. There are almost as many guesses as there are editions. I suspect that in the original poem there was one bird, speaking stanzas 34 and 37. Stanza 38 is little more, than a repetition of stanza 34, and may well have been a later addition. As for the stanzas in Fornyrthislag (32-53 and 35-36), they apparently come from another poem, in which several birds speak (cf. \"we sisters\" in stanza 35). This may be the same poem from which stanzas 40-44 were taken, as well as some of the Fornyrthislag stanzas in the ~<Sigrdrifumol~>.\n\n34. Some editions turn this speech from the third person into the second, but the manuscript is clear enough.]",

					"Thought he would give, | and the ravens gladden,\nThere is ever a wolf | where his ears I spy.\"\n\n~<A fifth spake:~>\n36. \"Less wise must be | the tree of battle\nThan to me would seem | the leader of men,\nIf forth he lets | one brother fare,\nWhen he of the other | the slayer is.\"\n\n~<A sixth spake:~>\n37. \"Most foolish he seems | if he shall spare\nHis foe, the bane of the folk,\nThere Regin lies, | who hath wronged him so,\nYet falsehood knows he not.\"\n\n~<A seventh spake:~>\n38. \"Let the head from the frost-cold | giant be hewed,\nAnd let him of rings be robbed;\nThen all the wealth | which Fafnir's was\nShall belong to thee alone.\"\n\n~<Sigurth spake:~>\n39. \"Not so rich a fate | shall Regin have\n\n[35. ~<Wolf~>, etc.: the phrase is nearly equivalent to \"there must be fire where there is smoke.\" The proverb appears else where in Old Norse.\n\n36. ~<Tree of battle~>: warrior.\n\n37. Here, as in stanza 34, some editions turn the speech from the third person into the second.\n\n38. ~<Giant~>: Regin was certainly not a frost-giant, and the whole stanza looks like some copyist's blundering reproduction of stanza 34.]",

					"As the tale of my death to tell;\nFor soon the brothers | both shall die,\nAnd hence to hell shall go.\"\n\nSigurth hewed off Regin's head, and then he ate Fafnir's heart, and drank the blood of both Regin and Fafnir. Then Sigurth heard what the nut-hatch said:\n\n40. \"Bind, Sigurth, the golden | rings together,\nNot kingly is it | aught to fear;\nI know a maid, | there is none so fair,\nRich in gold, | if thou mightest get her.\n\n41. \"Green the paths | that to Gjuki lead,\n\n[40. Neither the manuscript nor any of the editions suggest the existence of more than one bird in stanzas 40-44. it seems to me, however, that there are not only two birds, but two distinct stories. Stanzas 40-41 apply solely to Guthrun, and suggest that Sigurth will go straight to Gunnar's hall. Stanzas 42-44, on the other hand, apply solely to Brynhild, and indicate that Sigurth will find her before he visits the Gjukungs. The confusion which existed between these two versions of the story, and which involved a fundamental difference in the final working out of Brynhild's revenge, is commented on in the note on ~<Gripisspo~>, 13. In the present passage it is possible that two birds are speaking, each reflecting one version of the story; it seems even more likely that one speech or the other (40-41 or 42-44) reflects the original form of the narrative, the other having been added, either later or from another poem. In the ~<Volsungasaga~> the whole passage is condensed into a few words by one bird: \"Wiser were it if he should then ride up on Hindarfjoll, where Brynhild sleeps, and there would he get much wisdom.\" The Guthrun-bird does not appear at all.\n\n41. ~<Gjuki~>: father of Gunnar and Guthrun: cf. ~<Gripisspo~>, 13 and note.]",

Editors, until recently,]",

					"Sigurth rode along Fafnir's trail to his lair, and found it open. The gate-posts were of iron, and the gates; of iron, too, were all the beams in the house, which was dug down into the earth. There Sigurth found a mighty store of gold, and he filled two chests full thereof; he took the fear-helm and a golden mail-coat and the sword Hrotti, and many other precious things, and loaded Grani with them, but the horse would not go forward until Sigurth mounted on his back.\n\n[have followed him in this error, failing to recognize that \"sigrdrifa\" was simply an epithet for Brynhild. It is from this blunder that the so-called ~<Sigrdrifumol~> takes its name. Brynhild's dual personality as a Valkyrie and as the daughter of Buthli has made plenty of trouble, but the addition of a second Valkyrie in the person of the supposed \"Sigrdrifa\" has made still more.\n\n~<Prose~>.

					"~<Sigrdrifumol~>\n\n~<The Ballad of The Victory-Bringer~>\n\n~<Introductory Note~>\n\nThe so-called ~<Sigrdrifumol~>, which immediately follows the ~<Fafnismol~> in the ~<Codex Regius~> without any indication of a break, and without separate title, is unquestionably the most chaotic of all the poems in the Eddic collection. The end of it has been entirely lost, for the fifth folio of eight sheets is missing from ~<Regius~>, the gap coming after the first line of stanza 29 of this poem. That stanza has been completed, and eight more have been added, from much later paper manuscripts, but even so the conclusion of the poem is in obscurity.\n\nProperly speaking, however, the strange conglomeration of stanzas which the compiler of the collection has left for us, and which, in much the same general form, seems to have lain before the authors of the ~<Volsungasaga~>, in which eighteen of its stanzas are quoted, is not a poem at all. Even its customary title is an absurd error. The mistake made by the annotator in thinking that the epithet \"sigrdrifa,\" rightly applied to Brynhild as a \"bringer of victory,\" was a proper name has already been explained and commented on (note on ~<Fafnismol~>, 44). Even if the collection of stanzas were in any real sense a poem, which it emphatically is not, it is certainly not the \"Ballad of Sigrdrifa\" which it is commonly called. \"Ballad of Brynhild\" would be a sufficiently suitable title, and I have here brought the established name \"Sigrdrifumol\" into accord with this by translating the epithet instead of treating it as a proper name.\n\nEven apart from the title, however, the ~<Sigrdrifumol~> has little claim to be regarded as a distinct poem, nor is there any indication that the compiler did so regard it. Handicapped as we are by the loss of the concluding section, and of the material which followed it on those missing pages, we can yet see that the process which began with the prose ~<Fra Dautha Sinfjotla~>, and which, interrupted by the insertion of the ~<Gripisspo~>, went on through the ~<Reginsmol~> and the ~<Fafnismol~>, continued through as much of the ~<Sigrdrifumol~> as is left to us. In other words, the compiler told the story of Sigurth in mixed prose and verse, using whatever verse he could find without much questioning as to its origin, and filling in the gaps with hii own prose. ~<Fra~>",

					"~<Dautha Sinfjotla~>, ~<Reginsmol~>, ~<Fafnismol~>, and ~<Sigrdrifumol~> are essentially a coherent unit, but one of the compiler's making only; they represent neither one poem nor three distinct poems, and the divisions and titles which have been almost universally adopted by editors are both arbitrary and misleading.\n\nThe ~<Sigrdrifumol~> section as we now have it is an extraordinary piece of patchwork. It is most unlikely that the compiler himself brought all these fragments together for the first time; little by little, through a process of accretion and also, unluckily, through one of elimination, the material grew into its present shape. Certainly the basis of it is a poem dealing with the finding of Brynhild by Sigurth, but of this original poem only five stanzas (2-4 and 20-21) can be identified with any degree of confidence. To these five stanzas should probably, however, be added some, if not all, of the passage (stanzas 6-12) in which Brynhild teaches Sigurth the magic runes. These stanzas of rune-lore attracted sundry similar passages from other sources, including stanza 5, in which a magic draught is administered (not necessarily by Brynhild or to Sigurth), the curious rune-chant in stanzas 15-17, and stanzas 13-14 and 18-19. Beginning with stanza 22, and running to the end of the fragment (stanza 37), is a set of numbered counsels closely resembling the ~<Loddfafnismol~> (~<Hovamol~>, stanzas 111-138), which manifestly has nothing whatever to do with Brynhild. Even in this passage there are probably interpolations (stanzas 25, 27, 30, 54, and 36). Finally, and bespeaking the existence at some earlier time of another Sigurth-Brynhild poem, is stanza 1, sharply distinguished by its metrical form from stanzas 2-4 and 20-21. Many critics argue that stanzas 6-10 of ~<Helreith Brynildar~> belonged originally to the same poem as stanza 1 of the ~<Sigrdrifumol~>.\n\nThe ~<Sigrdrifumol~>, then, must be regarded simply as a collection of fragments, most of them originally having no relation to the main subject. All of the story, the dialogue and the characterization are embodied in stanzas 1-4 and 20-21 and in the prose notes accompanying the first four stanzas; all of the rest might equally well (or better) be transferred to the ~<Hovamol~>, where its character entitles it to a place. Yet stanzas 2-4 are as fine as anything in Old Norse poetry, and it is out of the scanty material of these three stanzas that Wagner constructed much of the third act of \"Siegfried.\"",

					"The ~<Sigrdrifumol~> represents almost exclusively the contributions of the North to the Sigurth tradition (cf. introductory note to the ~<Gripisspo~>). Brynhild, here disguised by the annotator as \"Sigrdrifa,\" appears simply as a battle-maid and supernatural dispenser of wisdom; there is no trace of the daughter of Buthli and the rival of Guthrun. There is, however, so little of the \"poem\" which can definitely be assigned to the Sigurth cycle that it is impossible to trace back any of the underlying narrative substance.\n\nThe nature and condition of the material have made editorial conjectures and emendations very numerous, and as most of the guesses are neither conclusive nor particularly important, only a few of their are mentioned in the notes.\n\n__________________\n\nSigurth rode up on Hindarfjoll and turned southward toward the land of the Franks. On the mountain he saw a great light, as if fire were burning, and the glow reached up to heaven. And when he came thither, there stood a tower of shields, and above it was a banner. Sigurth went into the shield-tower, and saw that a man lay there sleeping with all his war-weapons. First he took the helm from his head, and then he saw that it was a woman. The mail-coat was as fast as if it had grown to the flesh. Then he cut the mail-coat from the\n\n[~<Prose~>.

Hymiskvitha, 4 and note); \"tyr\" is also the name of a rune which became \"T.\"\n\n7. ~<Regius~> gives only lines 1-6; lines 7-8 are added from ~<Volsungasaga~>. ~<Lies~>, etc.: a guest on his arrival received a draught of ale from the hands of his host's wife, and it was to prevent this draught from bewitching him that the runes were recommended. ~<Need~>: the word \"nauth,\" meaning \"need,\" is also the name of the rune which became \"N.\" ~<Leek~>: leeks were long supposed to have the power of counteracting poison or witchcraft.]",

Stanzas 13-14 appear to have come from a passage regarding Othin's getting of the runes similar to ~<Hovamol~>, 139-146. Editors have tried various combinations of the lines in stanzas 12-14. ~<Hropt~>: Othin; cf. ~<Voluspo~>, 62. ~<The draught~>, etc.: apparently the reference is to the head of Mim, from which Othin derived his wisdom in magic (cf. ~<Voluspo~>, 47 and note); ~<Heithdraupnir~> (\"Light-Dropper\") and ~<Hoddrofnir~> (\"Treasure-Opener\") seem to be names for Mim.]",

The manuscript does not indicate the speaker of either this or the following stanza; the ~<Volsungasaga~> names Sigurth before stanza 21.\n\n21. It is quite possible that the original poem concluded with two stanzas after this, paraphrased thus in the ~<Volsungasaga~>: \"Sigurth said: 'Nowhere is to be found any one wiser than thou, and this I swear, that I shall have thee for mine, and that thou art after my heart's desire.' She answered: 'I would rather have thee though I might choose among all men.'

That the section originally had anything to do with Brynhild is more than improbable.\n\n23. ~<Wolf of his word~>: oath-destroyer, oath-breaker.\n\n25. This chaotic and obscure jumble of lines has been unsuccessfully \"improved\" by various editors. It is clearly an interpolation, meaning, in substance: \"It is dangerous to keep silent too long, as men may think you a coward; but if any one taunts]",

Probably another interpolation.\n\n28. ~<Silver of kinship~>: the passage is doubtful, but apparently it means the \"marriage-price\" for which a bride was \"bought.\"\n\n29.

The rest of stanza 29, and stanzas 50-37, are added from later paper manuscripts, which were undoubtedly copied from an old parchment, though probably not from the complete ~<Regius~>. The ~<Volsungasaga~> paraphrases these additional stanzas.\n\n30. Probably an interpolation.\n\n31. The meaning is that it is better to go forth to battle than to stay at home and be burned to death.

Lines 3-4 are probably interpolated. ~<Race of wolves~>: family of a slain foe.\n\n36. Probably an interpolation.\n\n37. Lines 3-4 may well have come from the old Sigurth-Brynhild poem, like stanzas 2-4 and 20-21, being inserted here, where they do not fit particularly well, in place of the two lines with which the eleventh counsel originally ended. Perhaps they formed part of the stanza of warning which evidently preceded Brynhild's speech in stanza 20. In the ~<Volsungasaga~> they are paraphrased at the end of Brynhild's long speech of advice (stanzas 20-37), and are immediately followed by the prose passage given in the note on stanza 21. It seems likely, therefore,]",
					
					"[that the paper manuscripts have preserved all of the so-called ~<Sigrdrifumol~> which was contained in the lost section of ~<Regius~>, with the possible exception of these two concluding stanzas, and these may very well have been given only in the form of a prose note, though it is practically certain that at one time they existed in verse form.]"

					"~<Brot Af Sigurtharkvithu~>\n\n~<Fragment of a Sigurth Lay~>\n\n~<Introductory Note~>\n\nThe gap of eight leaves in the ~<Codex Regius~> (cf. introductory note to the ~<Sigrdrifumol~>) is followed by a passage of twenty stanzas which is evidently the end of a longer poem, the greater part of it having been contained in the lost section of the manuscript. There is here little question of such a compilation as made up the so-called ~<Reginsmol~>, ~<Fafnismol~>, and ~<Sigrdrifumol~>; the extant fragment shows every sign of being part of a poem which, as it stood in the manuscript, was a complete and definite unit. The end is clearly marked; the following poem, ~<Guthrunarkvitha~> I, carries a specific heading in the manuscript, so that there is no uncertainty as to where the fragment closes.\n\nIt seems altogether likely that the twenty stanzas thus remaining are the end of a poem entitled ~<Sigurtharkvitha~> (Lay of Sigurth), and, more specifically, the \"Long\" Lay of Sigurth. The extant and complete Sigurth lay, a relatively late work, is referred to by the annotator as the \"Short\" Lay of Sigurth, which, of course, presupposes the existence of a longer poem with the same title. As the \"short\" lay is one of the longest poems in the whole collection (seventy stanzas), it follows that the other one must have been considerably more extensive in order to have been thus distinguished by its length. It may be guessed, then, that not less than eighty or a hundred stanzas, and possibly more, of the \"Long\" Lay of Sigurth have been lost with the missing pages of ~<Regius~>.\n\nThe narrative, from the point at which the so-called ~<Sigrdrifumol~> breaks off to that at which the ~<Brot~> takes it up, is given with considerable detail in the Volsungasaga. In this prose narrative four stanzas are quoted, and one of them is specifically introduced with the phrase: \"as is told in the Lay of Sigurth.\" It is possible, but most unlikely, that the entire passage paraphrases this poem alone; such an assumption would give the Lay of Sigurth not less than two hundred and fifty stanzas (allowing about fifteen stanzas to each of the missing pages), and moreover there are inconsistencies in the ~<Volsungasaga~> narrative suggesting that different and more or less conflicting poems were used as sources. The chances are that the \"Long\" Lay of Sigurth",

					"filled approximately the latter half of the lost section of the manuscript, the first half including poems of which the only trace is to be found in the ~<Volsungasaga~> prose paraphrase and in two of the stanzas therein quoted.\n\nThe course of the ~<Volsungasaga's~> story from the ~<Sigrdrifumol~> to the ~<Brot~> is, briefly, as follows. After leaving the Valkyrie, Sigurth comes to the dwelling of Heimir, Brynhild's brother-in-law, where he meets Brynhild and they swear oaths of fidelity anew (the ~<Volsungasaga~> is no more lucid with regard to the Brynhild-Sigrdrifa confusion than was the annotator of the poems). Then the scene shifts to the home of the Gjukungs. Guthrun, Gjuki's daughter, has a terrifying dream, and visits Brynhild to have it explained, which the latter does by foretelling pretty much everything that is going to happen; this episode was presumably the subject of a separate poem in the lost section of the manuscript. Guthrun returns home, and Sigurth soon arrives, to be made enthusiastically welcome. Grimhild, mother of Gunnar and Guthrun, gives him a magic draught which makes him forget all about Brynhild, and shortly thereafter he marries Guthrun.\n\nThen follows the episode of the winning of Brynhild for Gunnar (cf. ~<Gripisspo~>, 97 and note). This was certainly the subject of a poem, possibly of the first part of the \"Long\" Lay of Sigurth, although it seems more likely that the episode was dealt with in a separate poem. The ~<Volsungasaga~> quotes two stanzas describing Sigurth's triumphant passing through the flames after Gunnar has failed and the two have changed forms. They run thus:\n\nThe fire raged, | the earth was rocked,\nThe flames leaped high | to heaven itself;\nFew were the hardy | heroes would dare\nTo ride or leap | the raging flames.\n\nSigurth urged Grani | then with his sword,\nThe fire slackened | before the hero,\nThe flames sank low | for the greedy of fame,\nThe armor flashed | that Regin had fashioned.\n\nAfter Sigurth has spent three nights with Brynhild, laying his sword between them (cf. ~<Gripisspo~>, 41 and note), he and Gunnar return home, while Brynhild goes to the dwelling of her brother-in-law, Heimir, and makes ready for her marriage with Gunnar,",

					"directing Heimir to care for her daughter by Sigurth, Aslaug. The wedding takes place, to be followed soon after by the quarrel between Guthrun and Brynhild, in which the former betrays the fact that it was Sigurth, and not Gunnar, who rode through the flames. Brynhild speaks with contempt of Guthrun and her whole family, and the following stanza, which presumably be longs to the same Sigurth lay as the Brot, is quoted at this point:\n\nSigurth the dragon | slew, and that\nWill men recall | while the world remains;\nBut little boldness | thy brother had\nTo ride or leap | the raging flames.\n\nGunnar and Sigurth alike try to appease the angry Brynhild, but in vain. After Sigurth has talked with her, his leaving her hall is described in the following stanza, introduced by the specific phrase: \"as is said in the Lay of Sigurth\":\n\nForth went Sigurth, | and speech he sought not,\nThe friend of heroes, | his head bowed down;\nSuch was his grief | that asunder burst\nHis mail-coat all | of iron wrought.\n\nBrynhild then tells Gunnar that she had given herself wholly to Sigurth before she had become Gunnar's wife (the confusion between the two stories is commented on in the note to ~<Gripisspo~>, 47), and Gunnar discusses plans of vengance with his brother, Hogni. It is at this point that the action of the ~<Brot~> begins. Beginning with this poem, and thence to the end of the cycle, the German features of the narrative predominate (cf. introductory note to ~<Gripisspo~>).\n__________________\n\n~<Hogni spake:~>\n1. \"(What evil deed | has Sigurth) done,\nThat the hero's life | thou fain wouldst have?\"\n\n[1. The fragment begins with the last words of line I (probably line 3 of the stanza). A few editors ascribe this speech to Gunnar and the next to Brynhild; one reconstruction of lines 1-2 on this probably false assumption runs: \"Why art thou, Brynhild, |]", -- removed one line before the interval, to keep everything within the window's limit

					"~<Gunnar spake:~>\n2. \"Sigurth oaths | to me hath sworn,\nOaths hath sworn, | and all hath broken;\nHe betrayed me there | where truest all\nHis oaths, methinks, | he ought to have kept.\"\n\n~<Hogni spake:~>\n3. \"Thy heart hath Brynhild | whetted to hate,\nEvil to work | and harm to win,\nShe grudges the honor | that Guthrun has,\nAnd that joy of herself | thou still dost have.\"\n\n4. They cooked a wolf, | they cut up a snake,\nThey gave to Gotthorm | the greedy one's flesh,\nBefore the men, | to murder minded,\nLaid their hands | on the hero bold.\n\n5. Slain was Sigurth | south of the Rhine;\nFrom a limb a raven | called full loud:\n\n[daughter of Buthli, / Scheming ill | with evil counsel?\" ~<Hogni~> (German Hagene): brother of Gunnar and Guthrun.\n\n2. A few editors ascribe this speech to Brynhild. Gunnar, if the stanza is his, has believed Brynhild's statement regarding Sigurth's disloyalty to his blood-brother.\n\n4. The ~<Volsungasaga~> quotes a somewhat different version of this stanza, in which the snake is called \"wood-fish\" and the third line adds \"beer and many things.\" Eating snakes and the flesh of beasts of prey was commonly supposed to induce ferocity. ~<Gotthorm~>: Grimhild's son, half-brother to Gunnar. He it is who, not having sworn brotherhood with Sigurth, does the killing.\n\n5. In the manuscript this stanza stands between stanzas 11 and 12; most editions have made the change here indicated.]",

					"\"Your blood shall redden | Atli's blade,\nAnd your oaths shall bind | you both in chains.\"\n\n6. Without stood Guthrun, | Gjuki's daughter,\nHear now the speech | that first she spake:\n\"Where is Sigurth now, | the noble king,\nThat my kinsmen riding | before him come?\"\n\n7. Only this | did Hogni answer:\n\"Sigurth we | with our swords have slain;\nThe gray horse mourns | by his master dead.\"\n\n8. Then Brynhild spake, | the daughter of Buthli:\n\"Well shall ye joy | in weapons and lands;\nSigurth alone | of all had been lord,\nIf a little longer | his life had been.\n\n9. \"Right were it not | that so he should rule\nO'er Gjuki's wealth | and the race of the Goths;\n\n[~<South of the Rhine~>: the definite localization of the action shows how clearly all this part of the story was recognized in the North as of German origin. ~<Atli~> (Attila; cf. introductory note to ~<Gripisspo~>): the Northern version of the story makes him Brynhild's brother. His marriage with Guthrun, and his slaying of hex brothers, are told in the Atli poems. Regarding the manner of Sigurth's death cf. concluding prose passage and note. Stanza 13 indicates that after stanza 5 a stanza containing the words of an eagle has been lost.\n\n7. One line of this stanza, but it is not clear which, seems to have been lost. ~<The~> ~<gray~> ~<horse~>: Grani.\n\n8. Some editions set stanzas 8 and 9 after stanza 11; Sijmons marks them as spurious. ~<Buthli~>: cf. ~<Gripisspo~>, 19, note.\n\n9. ~<Goths~>: a generic term for any German race; cf. Gripisspo,]",

					"Five are the sons | for ruling the folk,\nAnd greedy of fight, | that he hath fathered.\"\n\n10. Then Brynhild laughed-- | and the building echoed--\nOnly once, | with all her heart;\n\"Long shall ye joy | in lands and men,\nNow ye have slain | the hero noble.\"\n\n11. Then Guthrun spake, | the daughter of Gjuki:\n\"Much thou speakest | in evil speech;\nAccursed be Gunnar, | Sigurth's killer,\nVengeance shall come | for his cruel heart.\"\n\n12. Early came evening, | and ale was drunk,\nAnd among them long | and loud they talked.;\nThey slumbered all | when their beds they sought,\nBut Gunnar alone | was long awake.\n\n13. His feet were tossing, | he talked to himself,\nAnd the slayer of hosts | began to heed\nWhat the twain from the tree | had told him then,\nThe raven and eagle, | as home they rode.\n\n[35 and note. ~<Five sons~>: according to the ~<Volsungasaga~> Sigurth had only one son, named Sigmund, who was killed at Brynhild's behest. ~<Sigurtharkvitha en skamma~> and ~<Guthrunarkvitha II~> like wise mention only one son. The daughter of Sigurth and Guthrun, Svanhild, marries Jormunrek (Ermanarich).\n\n12. The manuscript marks line 4 as the beginning of a new stanza, and a few editions combine it with stanza 13.\n\n13. ~<Slayer of hosts~>: warrior (Gunnar). ~<Raven and eagle~>: cf. note on stanza 5.]",

					"14. Brynhild awoke, | the daughter of Buthli,\nThe warrior's daughter, | ere dawn of day:\n\"Love me or hate me, | the harm is done,\nAnd my grief cries out, | or else I die.\"\n\n15. Silent were all | who heard her speak,\nAnd nought of the heart | of the queen they knew,\nWho wept such tears | the thing to tell\nThat laughing once | of the men she had won.\n\n~<Brynhild spake:~>\n16. \"Gunnar, I dreamed | a dream full grim:\nIn the hall were corpses; | cold was my bed;\nAnd, ruler, thou | didst joyless ride,\nWith fetters bound | in the foemen's throng.\n\n17. \". . . . .  . . . . .\n. . . . .  . . . . .\nUtterly now your | Niflung race\nAll shall die; | your oaths ye have broken.\n\n[16. Mogk regards stanzas 16 and 17 as interpolated, but on not very satisfactory grounds. On the death of Gunnar cf. ~<Drap Niflunga~>.\n\n17. No gap is indicated in the manuscript, and some editions attach these two lines to stanza 16. ~<Niflungs~>: this name (German Nibelungen), meaning \"sons of the mist,\" seems to have belonged originally to the race of supernatural beings to which the treasure belonged in the German version. It was subsequently ex tended to include the Gjukungs and their Burgundians. This question, of minor importance in the Norse poems, has evoked an enormous amount of learned discussion in connection with the ~<Nibelungenlied~>.]",

					"18. \"Thou hast, Gunnar, | the deed forgot,\nWhen blood in your footprints | both ye mingled;\nAll to him | hast repaid with ill\nWho fain had made thee | the foremost of kings.\n\n19. \"Well did he prove, | when proud he rode\nTo win me then | thy wife to be,\nHow true the host-slayer | ever had held\nThe oaths he had made | with the monarch young.\n\n20. \"The wound-staff then, | all wound with gold,\nThe hero let | between us lie;\nWith fire the edge | was forged full keen,\nAnd with drops of venom | the blade was damp.\"\n\nHere it is told in this poem about the death of Sigurth, and the story goes here that they slew him out of doors, but some say that they slew him in the house, on his bed\n\n[19. ~<Footprints~>: the actual mingling of blood in one another's footprints was a part of the ceremony of swearing blood-brother hood, the oath which Gunnar and Sigurth had taken. The fourth line refers to the fact that Sigurth had won many battles for Gunnar.\n\n20. Regarding the sword episode cf. ~<Gripisspo~>, 41 and note. ~<Wound-staff~>: sword.\n\n~<Prose~>. This prose passage has in the manuscript, written in red, the phrase \"Of Sigurth's Death\" as a heading; there is no break between it and the prose introducing ~<Guthrunarkvitha I~>, the heading for that poem coming just before stanza 1. This note is of special interest as an effort at real criticism. The annotator, troubled by the two versions of the story of Sigurth's death, feels it incumbent on him not only to point the fact out, but to cite the authority of \"German men\" for the form which appears]",

					"while he was sleeping. But German men say that they killed him out of doors in the forest; and so it is told in the old Guthrun lay, that Sigurth and Gjuki's sons had ridden to the council-place, and that he was slain there. But in this they are all agreed, that they deceived him in his trust of them, and fell upon him when he was lying down and unprepared.\n\n[in this poem. The alternative version, wherein Sigurth is slain in bed, appears in ~<Sigurtharkvitha en skamma~>, ~<Guthrunarhvot~>, and ~<Hamthesmol~>, and also in the ~<Volsungasaga~>, which tells how Gotthorm tried twice to kill Sigurth but was terrified by the brightness of his eyes, and succeeded only after the hero had fallen asleep, That the annotator was correct in citing German authority for the slaying of Sigurth in the forest is shown by the ~<Nibelungenlied~> and the ~<Thithrekssaga~>. The \"old\" Guthrun lay is unquestionably ~<Guthrunarkvitha II~>.]"

					"~<Guthrunarkvitha I~>\n\n~<The First Lay of Guthrun~>\n\n~<Introductory Note~>\n\nThe ~<First Lay of Guthrun~>, entitled in the ~<Codex Regius~> simply ~<Guthrunarkvitha~>, immediately follows the remaining fragment of the \"long\" Sigurth lay in that manuscript. Unlike the poems dealing with the earlier part of the Sigurth cycle, the so-called ~<Reginsmol~>, ~<Fafnismol~>, and ~<Sigrdrifumol~>, it is a clear and distinct unit, apparently complete and with few and minor interpolations. It is also one of the finest poems in the entire collection, with an extraordinary emotional intensity and dramatic force. None of its stanzas are quoted elsewhere, and it is altogether probable that the compilers of the ~<Volsungasaga~> were unfamiliar with it, for they do not mention the sister and daughter of Gjuki who appear in this poem, or Herborg, \"queen of the Huns\" (stanza 6).\n\nThe lament of Guthrun (Kriemhild) is almost certainly among the oldest parts of the story. The lament was one of the earliest forms of poetry to develop among the Germanic peoples, and I suspect, though the matter is not susceptible of proof, that the lament of Sigurth's wife had assumed lyric form as early as the seventh century, and reached the North in that shape rather than in prose tradition (cf. ~<Guthrunarkvitha II~>, introductory note). We find traces of it in the seventeenth Aventiure of the ~<Nibelungenlied~>, and in the poems of the ~<Edda~> it dominates every appearance of Guthrun. The two first Guthrun lays (I and II) are both laments, one for Sigurth's death and the other including both that and the lament over the slaying of her brothers; the lament theme is apparent in the third Guthrun lay and in the ~<Guthrunarhvot~>.\n\nIn their present forms the second Guthrun lay is undoubtedly older than he first; in the prose following the ~<Brot~> the annotator refers to the \"old\" Guthrun lay in terms which can apply only to the second one in the collection. The shorter and \"first\" lay, therefore, can scarcely have been composed much before the year 1000, and may be somewhat later. The poet appears to have known and made use of the older lament; stanza 17, for example, is a close parallel to stanza 2 of the earlier poem; but whatever material he used he fitted into a definite poetic scheme of his",

					"own. And while this particular poem is, as critics have generally agreed, one of the latest of the collection, it probably represents one of the earliest parts of the entire Sigurth cycle to take on verse form.\n\n~<Guthrunarkvitha I~>, so far as the narrative underlying it is concerned, shows very little northern addition to the basic German tradition. Brynhild appears only as Guthrun's enemy and the cause of Sigurth's death; the three women who attempt to comfort Guthrun, though unknown to the southern stories, seem to have been rather distinct creations of the poet's than traditional additions to the legend. Regarding the relations of the various elements in the Sigurth cycle, cf. introductory note to ~<Gripisspo~>.\n\n__________________\n\nGuthrun sat by the dead Sigurth; she did not weep as other women, but her heart was near to bursting with grief. The men and women came to her to console her, but that was not easy to do. It is told of men that Guthrun had eaten of Fafnir's heart, and that she under stood the speech of birds. This is a poem about Guthrun.\n\n1. Then did Guthrun | think to die,\nWhen she by Sigurth | sorrowing sat;\nTears she had not, | nor wrung her hands,\nNor ever wailed, | as other women.\n\n[~<Prose~>. The prose follows the concluding prose of the ~<Brot~> without indication of a break, the heading standing immediately before stanza 1. ~<Fafnir's heart~>: this bit of information is here quite without point, and it is nowhere else stated that Guthrun understood the speech of birds. In the ~<Volsungasaga~> it is stated that Sigurth gave Guthrun some of Fafnir's heart to eat, \"and thereafter she was much grimmer than before, and wiser.\"\n\n1. This stanza seems to be based on Guthrunarkvitha II, 11-12.]",

Some editors assume the loss of a line, after either line 1 or line 3.

The manuscript does not name the speaker, and some editions have a first line, \"Then Guthrun spake, the daughter of Gjuki.\"\n\n18. ~<Herjan~>: Othin; his maids are the Valkyries; cf. ~<Voluspo~>, 31, where the same phrase is used.]",

Then Brynhild spake, | the daughter of Buthli:\n\"May the witch now husband | and children want\nWho, Guthrun, loosed | thy tears at last,\nAnd with magic today | hath made thee speak.\"\n\n[20. Line 4 looks like an interpolation (cf. ~<Fafnismol~>, 9, line 4), but some editors instead have queried line 5. How Guthrun's curse is fulfilled is told in the subsequent poems. That desire for Sigurth's treasure (the gold cursed by Andvari and Loki) was one of the motives for his murder is indicated in ~<Sigurtharkvitha en skamma~> (stanza 16), and was clearly a part of the German tradition, as it appears in the ~<Nibelungenlied~>.\n\n21. Cf. ~<Gripisspo~>, 35 and note.\n\n22. Line 1 is abbreviated in the manuscript.]",

Then Brynhild, daughter | of Buthli, spake:\n\"Atli is guilty | of all the sorrow,\n(Son of Buthli | and brother of mine,)\nWhen we saw in the hall | of the Hunnish race\nThe flame of the snake's bed | flash round the hero;\n(For the journey since | full sore have I paid,\nAnd ever I seek | the sight to forget.)\"\n\n[23. Editors are agreed that this stanza shows interpolations, but differ as to the lines to reject. Line 4 (literally \"every wave of ill-doing drives thee\") is substantially a proverb, and line 5, with its apparently meaningless reference to \"seven\" kings, may easily have come from some other source.\n\n24. The stanza is obviously in bad shape; perhaps it represents two separate stanzas, or perhaps three of the lines are later additions. ~<Atli~>: Brynhild here blames her brother, following the frequent custom of transferring the responsibility for a murder (cf. ~<Helgakvitha Hundingsbana II~>, 33), because he compelled her to marry Gunnar against her will, an idea which the poet seems to have gained from ~<Sigurtharkvitha en skamma~>, 32-39. These stanzas represent an entirely different version of the story, wherein Atli, attacked by Gunnar and Sigurth, buys them off by giving Gunnar his sister, Brynhild, as wife. He seems to have induced the latter to marry Gunnar by falsely telling her that Gunnar was Sigurth (a rationalistic explanation of the interchange of forms described in the ~<Volsungasaga~> and ~<Gripisspo~>, 37-39). In the present stanza Atli is made to do this out of desire for Sigurth's treasure. ~<Hunnish race~>: this may be]",

Brynhild would not live after Sigurth. She had eight of her thralls slain and five serving-women. Then she killed her self with a sword, as is told in the Short Lay of Sigurth.\n\n[merely an error (neither Gunnar nor Sigurth could properly have been connected in any way with Atli and his Huns), based on ~<Sigurtharkvitha en skamma~>, wherein Sigurth appears more than once as the \"Hunnish king.\" The North was very much in the dark as to the differences between Germans, Burgundians, Franks, Goths, and Huns, and used the words without much discrimination. On the other hand, it may refer to Sigurth's appearance when, adorned with gold, he came with Gunnar to besiege Atli, in the alternative version of the story just cited (cf. ~<Sigurtharkvitha en skamma~>, 36). ~<Flame of the snake's bed~>: gold, so called because serpents and dragons were the' traditional guardians of treasure, on which they lay.\n\n~<Prose~>. The manuscript has \"Gunnar\" in place of \"Guthrun,\" but this is an obvious mistake; the entire prose passage is based on ~<Guthrunarkvitha II~>, 14. The ~<Volsungasaga~> likewise merely paraphrases ~<Guthrunarkvitha II~>, and nothing further is known of Thora or her father, Hokon, though many inconclusive attempts have been made to identify the latter. ~<Brynhild~>: the story of her death is told in great detail in the latter part of ~<Sigurtharkvitha~> ~<en~> ~<skamma~>.]"

					"~<Sigurtharkvitha En Skamma~>\n\n~<The Short Lay of Sigurth~>\n\n~<Introductory Note~>\n\n~<Guthrunarkvitha I~> is immediately followed in the ~<Codex Regius~> by a long poem which in the manuscript bears the heading \"Sigurtharkvitha,\" but which is clearly referred to in the prose link between it and ~<Guthrunarkvitha I~> as the \"short\" Lay of Sigurth. The discrepancy between this reference and the obvious length of the poem has led to many conjectures, but the explanation seems to be that the \"long\" Sigurth lay, of which the ~<Brot~> is presumably a part, was materially longer even than this poem. The efforts to reduce the \"short\" Sigurth lay to dimensions which would justify the appellation in comparison with other poems in the collection, either by separating it into two poems or by the rejection of many stanzas as interpolations, have been utterly inconclusive.\n\nAlthough there are probably several interpolated passages, and indications of omissions are not lacking, the poem as we now have it seems to be a distinct and coherent unit. From the narrative point of view it leaves a good deal to be desired, for the reason that the poet's object was by no means to tell a story, with which his hearers were quite familiar, but to use the narrative simply as the background for vivid and powerful characterization. The lyric element, as Mogk points out, overshadows the epic throughout, and the fact that there are frequent confusions of narrative tradition does not trouble the poet at all.\n\nThe material on which the poem was based seems to have existed in both prose and verse form; the poet was almost certainly familiar with some of the other poems in the Eddic collection, with poems which have since been lost, and with the narrative prose traditions which never fully assumed verse form. The fact that he seems to have known and used the ~<Oddrunargratr~>, which can hardly have been composed before 1050, and that in any case he introduces the figure of Oddrun, a relatively late addition to the story, dates the poem as late as the end of the eleventh century, or even the first half of the twelfth. There has been much discussion as to where it was composed, the debate centering chiefly on the reference to glaciers (stanza 8). There is something to be said in favor of Greenland",

					"as the original home of the poem (cf. introductory note to ~<Atlakvitha~>), but the arguments for Iceland are even stronger; Norway in this case is practically out of the question.\n\nThe narrative features of the poem are based on the German rather than the Norse elements of the story (cf. introductory note to ~<Gripisspo~>), but the poet has taken whatever material he wanted without much discrimination as to its source. By the year 1100 the story of Sigurth, with its allied legends, existed through out the North in many and varied forms, and the poem shows traces of variants of the main story which do not appear elsewhere.\n\n1. Of old did Sigurth | Gjuki seek,\nThe Volsung young, | in battles victor;\nWell he trusted | the brothers twain,\nWith mighty oaths | among them sworn.\n\n2. A maid they gave him, | and jewels many,\nGuthrun the young, | the daughter of Gjuki;\nThey drank and spake | full many a day,\nSigurth the young | and Gjuki's sons.\n\n3. Thereafter went they | Brynhild to woo,\nAnd so with them | did Sigurth ride,\n\n[1. ~<Gjuki~>: father of the brothers twain, Gunnar and Hogni, and of Guthrun. In this version of the story Sigurth goes straight to the home of the Gjukungs after his victory over the dragon Fafnir, without meeting Brynhild on the way (cf. ~<Gripisspo~>, 13 and note). ~<Volsung~>: Sigurth's grandfather was Volsung; cf. ~<Fra Dautha Sinfjotla~> and note. ~<Oaths~>: regarding the blood-brother hood sworn by Sigurth, Gunnar, and Hogni cf. ~<Brot~>, 18 and note.\n\n3. Brynhild: on the winning of Brynhild by Sigurth in Gunnar's shape cf. ~<Gripisspo~>, 37 and note. The poet here omits details,]",

					"The Volsung young, | in battle valiant,--\nHimself would have had her | if all he had seen.\n\n4. The southern hero | his naked sword,\nFair-flashing, let | between them lie;\n(Nor would he come | the maid to kiss;)\nThe Hunnish king | in his arms ne'er held\nThe maiden he gave | to Gjuki's sons.\n\n5. Ill she had known not | in all her life,\nAnd nought of the sorrows | of men she knew;\nBlame she had not, | nor dreamed she should bear it,\nBut cruel the fates | that among them came.\n\n[and in stanzas 32-39 appears a quite different tradition regarding the winning of Brynhild, which I suspect he had in mind throughout the poem.\n\n4. ~<Southern hero~>: Sigurth, whose Frankish origin is seldom wholly lost sight of in the Norse versions of the story. On the episode of the sword cf. ~<Gripisspo~>, 41 and note. Line 3 may well be an interpolation; both lines 4 and 5 have also been questioned, and some editions combine line 5 with lines 1-3 of stanza 5. ~<Hunnish king~>: Sigurth, who was, of course, not a king of the Huns, but was occasionally so called in the later poems owing to the lack of ethnological distinction made by the Norse poets (cf. ~<Guthrunarkvitha I~>, 24 and note).\n\n5. This stanza may refer, as Gering thinks, merely to the fact that Brynhild lived happy and unsuspecting as Gunnar's wife until the fatal quarrel with Guthrun (cf. ~<Gripisspo~>, 45 and note) revealed to her the deceit whereby she had been won, or it may refer to the version of the story which appears in stanzas 32-39, wherein Brynhild lived happily with Atli, her brother, until he was attacked by Gunnar and Sigurth, and was compelled to give his sister to Gunnar, winning her consent thereto by representing] ",

Oft did she go | with grieving heart\nOn the glacier's ice | at even-tide,\nWhen Guthrun then | to her bed was gone,\nAnd the bedclothes Sigurth | about her laid.\n\n9. \" (Now Gjuki's child | to her lover goes,)\n\n[Gunnar as Sigurth, her chosen hero (cf. ~<Guthrunarkvitha I~>, 24 and note). The manuscript marks line 4 as the beginning of a new stanza, and many editors combine it with stanza 6.\n\n6. Brynhild has now discovered the deceit that has been practised on her. That she had loved Sigurth from the outset (cf. stanza 40) fits well with the version of the story wherein Sigurth meets her before he comes to Gunnar's home (the version not used in this poem), or the one outlined in the note on stanza 5, but does not accord with the story of Sigurth's first meeting Brynhild in Gunnar's form-an added reason for believing that the poet in stanzas 5-6 had in mind the story represented by stanzas 32-39. ~<The hero~>: the manuscript originally had the phrase thus, then corrected it to \"though I die,\" and finally crossed out the correction. Many editions have \"I.\"\n\n7. Perhaps a line is missing after line 3.\n\n8. ~<Glacier~>: a bit of Icelandic (or Greenland) local color.\n\n9. Line 1 does not appear in the manuscript, and is based on]",

The manuscript indicates line 3 as the beginning of a stanza, and some editors assume a gap of two lines after line 4. ~<Hunnish king~>: cf. stanza 4.\n\n10. ~<Lands~>: Brynhild's wealth again points to the story represented by stanzas 32-39; elsewhere she is not spoken of as bringing wealth to Gunnar.\n\n11.

This stanza has been the subject of many conjectural emendations. Some editions assume a gap after line 2, and make a separate stanza of lines 3-7; others mark lines 5-7 as spurious. The stanza seems to have been expanded by repetition. ~<Grief~> (line 1): the manuscript has \"wrath,\" involving a metrical error.\n\n14. Bugge and Gering transfer lines 4-5 to the beginning of stanza 16, on the basis of the ~<Volsungasaga~> paraphrase, and assume a gap of one line after line 3. Line 5, which is in the nature of a stereotyped clause, may well be interpolated.\n\n15. After \"Buthli\" in line 2 the manuscript has \"my brother,\" apparently a scribal error. In line 4 the manuscript has \"wealth\" instead of \"love,\" apparently with stanza 10, in mind, but the ~<Volsungasaga~> paraphrase has \"love,\" and many editors have suspected an error.\n\n16. Cf. note on stanza 14. After thus adding lines 4-5 of]",

That greed for Sigurth's wealth was one of the motives for his slaying is indicated likewise in ~<Guthrunarkvitha I~>, 20, and in the German versions of the story.\n\n18. ~<We four~>: if line 1 of stanza 19 is spurious, or the reference therein to \"five\" is a blunder, as may well be the case, then the \"four\" are Sigurth and the three brothers, Gunnar, Hogni, and Gotthorm. But it may be that the poet had in mind a tradition which, as in the ~<Thithrekssaga~>, gave Gjuki a fourth son, in which case the \"four\" refers only to the four Gjukungs. ~<Hunnish hero~>: Sigurth; cf. stanza 4 and note. Some editions put line 4 between lines 1 and 2. Some add lines 1-2 of stanza 19 to stanza 18, marking them as spurious.\n\n19. ~<We five~>: see note on preceding stanza. Some editors mark]",

The manuscript does not name the speaker. ~<Gotthorm~> (the name is variously spelt): half-brother of Gunnar and Hogni (cf. ~<Hyndluljoth~>, 27 and note, and ~<Brot~>, 4 and note). The name is the northern form of Gundomar; a prince of this name is mentioned in the ~<Lex Burgundionum~>, apparently as a brother of Gundahari (Gundicarius). In the ~<Nibelungenlied~> the third brother is called Gernot.\n\n21. No gap is indicated in the manuscript, and many editors combine stanza 21 with stanza 22, but it seems likely that not only two lines, but one or more stanzas in addition, have been lost; cf. ~<Brot~>, 4, and also the detailed account of the slaying of Sigurth in the ~<Volsungasaga~>, wherein, as here, Sigurth is killed in his bed (cf. stanza 24) and not in the forest.\n\n22. Some editions combine lines 3-4 with stanza 23. ~<Gram~>:]",

A line may well have been lost from this stanza.\n\n24. ~<Freyr~>: if the phrase \"the friend of Freyr\" means any thing more than \"king\" (cf. ~<Rigsthula~>, 46 etc.), which I doubt, it has reference to the late tradition that Freyr, and not Othin, was the ancestor of the Volsungs (cf. ~<Helgakvitha Hundingsbana I~>, 57 and note).\n\n25. Müllenhoff thinks this stanza, or at any rate lines 1-2, a later addition based on stanza 29.\n\n26. ~<My son~>: Sigmund; cf. stanza 12 and note, and also ~<Brot~>, 9 and note.]",

Sigurth means that although Guthrun may have seven sons by a later marriage, none of them will equal Sigmund, \"son of their (i.e., Gunnar's and Hogni's) sister.\" ~<Thing~>: council.\n\n28. Sigurth's protestation of guiltlessness fits perfectly with the story of his relations with Brynhild used in this poem, but not, of course, with the alternative version, used in the ~<Gripisspo~> and elsewhere, wherein Sigurth meets Brynhild before he woos her for Gunnar, and they have a daughter, Aslaug.\n\n29. Cf. ~<Guthrunarkvitha I~>, 115.\n\n30. Cf. ~<Brot~>, 10.]",

Line 1 may well be a mere expansion of \"Gunnar spake.\" The manuscript marks line 4 as the beginning of a new stanza, and some editions combine lines 4-5 with stanza 32.\n\n32. This stanza, which all editors have accepted as an integral part of the poem, apparently refers to the same story represented by stanzas 37-39, which most editors have (I believe mistakenly) marked as interpolated. As is pointed out in the notes on stanzas 3, 5, 6 and 10, the poet throughout seems to have accepted the version of the story wherein Gunnar and Sigurth besiege Atli, and are bought off by the gift of Atli's sister, Brynhild, to Gunnar as wife, her consent being won by Atli's representation that Gunnar is Sigurth (cf. also ~<Guthrunarkvitha I~>, 24 and note).\n\n33. The manuscript does not name the speaker, and some editions add a first line: \"Then Brynhild, daughter | of Buthli, spake.\"]",

Cf. stanza 5.\n\n35. ~<Three kings~>: Gunnar, Hogni, and Sigurth.\n\n36. Some editions place this stanza after stanza 39, on the theory that stanzas 37-39 are interpolated. Line 4, as virtually a repetition of line 3, has generally been marked as spurious. In this version of the winning of Brynhild it appears that Atli pointed out Sigurth as Gunnar, and Brynhild promptly fell in love with the hero whom, as he rode on ~<Grani~> and was decked with some of the spoils taken from Fafnir, she recognized as the dragon's slayer. Thus no change of form between Sigurth and Gunnar was necessary. The oath to marry Gunnar had to be carried out even after Brynhild had discovered the deception.\n\n37. Most editors mark stanzas 37-39 as interpolated, but cf. note on stanza 32. Stanza 37 has been variously emended. Lines 4 and 6 look like interpolated repetitions, but many editors make]",

Brynhild here again appears as a Valkyrie. The manuscript marks line 4 as the beginning of a new stanza. Any one of the last three lines may be spurious.\n\n39. Some editions combine this stanza with lines 4-5 of stanza 38, with lines 1-2 of stanza 40, or with the whole of stanza 40. ~<The bond~>: Brynhild thought she was marrying Sigurth, owner of the treasure, whereas she was being tricked into marrying Gunnar.]",

Brynhild's statement in lines 1-2 seems to refer to the episode, not here mentioned but told in detail in the ~<Volsungasaga~>, of Sigurth's effort to repair the wrong that has been done her by himself giving up Guthrun in her favor, an offer which she refuses. The lacuna here suggested, which is not indicated in the manuscript, may be simply a single line (line 1) or a stanza or more. After line 2 there is almost certainly a gap of at least one stanza, and possibly more, in which Brynhild states her determination to die.\n\n42. Hardly any two editions agree as to the arrangement of the lines in stanzas 42-44. I have followed the manuscript except in transposing line 4 of stanza 43 to this position from the place it holds in the manuscript after line 4 of stanza 14. All the other involve the rejection of two or more lines as spurious and the assumption of various gaps. Gering and Sijmons both arrange the lines thus: 42, 1-2; two-line gap; 43, 3]",

Perhaps the remains of two stanzas; the manuscript marks line 4 as the beginning of a new stanza, and after line 4 an added line has been suggested: \"She was ever known for evil thoughts.\" On the other hand, line 1, identical with line 31 of stanza 17, may well be a mere expansion of \"Hogni spake,\" and line 6 may have been introduced, with a slight variation, from line 5 of stanza 38. ~<Born again~>: this looks like a trace of Christian influence (the poem was composed well after the coming of Christianity to Iceland) in the assumption that if Brynhild killed herself she could not be \"born again\" (cf. concluding prose to ~<Helgakvitha Hundingsbana II~>).\n\n46.

The manuscript marks line 3, and not line 1, as beginning a stanza, and some editions treat lines 3-4 as a separate stanza, or combine them with stanza 48.\n\n48. Brynhild means, as stanzas 49-51 show, that those of her women who wish to win rewards must be ready to follow her in death. The word translated \"women\" in line 1 is conjectural, but the general meaning is clear enough.\n\n49. In place of \"as so she spake\" in line 1 the manuscript has]",

No gap indicated in the manuscript; many editions place it between lines 3 and 4. ~<Menja's wealth~>: gold; the story of the mill Grotti, whereby the giantesses Menja and Fenja ground gold for King Frothi, is told in the ~<Grottasongr~>.\n\n52. With this stanza begins Brynhild's prophesy of what is to befall Gunnar, Guthrun, Atli, and the many others involved in their fate. Line 3 is a proverbial expression meaning simply \"your troubles are not at an end.\"\n\n53. No gap is indicated in the manuscript; one suggestion for line 2 runs: \"Grimhild shall make her | to laugh once]",

Probably a line has been lost from this stanza. Grundtvig adds as a new first line: \"Her shalt thou find in the hall of Half.\" Some editions query line 3 as possibly spurious. ~<Svanhild~>: the figure of Svanhild is exceedingly old. The name means \"Swan-Maiden-Warrior,\" applying to just such mixtures of swan-maiden and Valkyrie as appear in the ~<Völundarkvitha~>. Originally part of a separate tradition, Svanhild appears first to have been incorporated in the Jormunrek (Ermanarich) story as the unhappy wife of that monarch, and much later to have been identified as the daughter of Sigurth and Guthrun, thus linking the two sets of legends.\n\n55. Line 2 in the original is almost totally obscure. Line 4 should very possibly precede line 2, while line 5 looks like an unwarranted addition.\n\n56. This stanza probably ought to follow stanza 52, as it refers solely to) the winning of Brynhild by Gunnar and Sigurth. Müllenhoff regards stanzas 53-55 as interpolated. The manuscript indicates no gap after line 3.]",

Stanzas 57-58 seem to be the remains of two stanzas, but the ~<Volsungasaga~> paraphrase follows closely the form here given. Line 3 may well be spurious; line 5 has likewise been questioned. ~<Oddrun~>: this sister of Atli and Brynhild, known mainly through the ~<Oddrunargratr~>, is a purely northern addition to the cycle, and apparently one of a relatively late date. She figures solely by reason of her love affair with Gunnar.\n\n58. Possibly two lines have been lost; many editions combine the two remaining lines with lines 1-3 of stanza 59. Concerning the manner of Gunnar's death cf. ~<Drap Niflunga~>.\n\n59. Line 3 may well be spurious, as it is largely repetition. The manuscript has \"sofa\" (\"sleep\") in place of \"sona\" (\"sons\"), but the ~<Volsungasaga~> paraphrase says clearly \"sons.\" The slaying of Atli by Guthrun in revenge for his killing of her brothers is told in the two Atli lays. The manuscript marks line 4 as the beginning of a new stanza, and some editions make a separate stanza out of lines 4-5, or else combine them with stanza 60.\n\n60. ~<To follow in death~>: this phrase is not in ~<Regius~>, but is]",

In place of lines 3-4 the manuscript has one line \"Two at his head, and a pair of hawks\"; the addition is made from the ~<Volsungasaga~> paraphrase. The burning or burying of slaves or beasts to accompany their masters in death was a general custom in the North. The number of slaves indicated in this stanza does not tally with the one given in stanza 69, wherefore Vigfusson rejects most of this stanza.]",

					"~<Helreith Brynhildar~>\n\n~<Brynhild's Hell-Ride~>\n\n~<Introductory Note~>\n\nThe little ~<Helreith Brynhildar~> immediately follows the \"short\" Sigurth lay in the ~<Codex~> ~<Regius~>, being linked to it by the brief prose note; the heading, \"Brynhild's Ride on Hel-Way,\" stands just before the first stanza. The entire poem, with the exception of stanza. 6, is likewise quoted in the ~<Nornageststhattr~>. Outside of one stanza (No. 11), which is a fairly obvious interpolation, the poem possesses an extraordinary degree of dramatic unity, and, certain pedantic commentators notwithstanding, it is one of the most vivid and powerful in the whole collection. None the less, it has been extensively argued that parts of it belonged originally to the so-called ~<Sigrdrifumol~>. That it stands in close relation to this poem is evident enough, but it is difficult to believe that such a masterpiece of dramatic poetry was ever the result of mere compilation. It seems more reasonable to regard the ~<Helreith~>, with the exception of stanza 11 and allowing for the loss of two lines from stanza 6, as a complete and carefully constructed unit, based undoubtedly on older poems, but none the less an artistic creation in itself.\n\nThe poem is generally dated as late as the eleventh century, and the concluding stanza betrays Christian influence almost unmistakably. It shows the confusion of traditions manifest in all the later poems; for example, Brynhild is here not only a Valkyrie but also a swan-maiden. Only three stanzas have any reference to the Guthrun-Gunnar part of the story; otherwise the poem is concerned solely with the episode of Sigurth's finding the sleeping Valkyrie. Late as it is, therefore, it is essentially a Norse creation, involving very few of the details of the German cycle (cf. introductory note to ~<Gripisspo~>).\n\n__________________\n\nAfter the death of Brynhild there were made two bale-fires, the one for Sigurth, and that burned first, and on the other was Brynhild burned, and she was on a",

					"wagon which was covered with a rich cloth. Thus it is told, that Brynhild went in the wagon on Hel-way, and passed by a house where dwelt a certain giantess. The giantess spake:\n\n1. \"Thou shalt not further | forward fare,\nMy dwelling ribbed | with rocks across;\nMore seemly it were | at thy weaving to stay,\nThan another's husband | here to follow.\n\n2. \"What wouldst thou have | from Valland here,\nFickle of heart, | in this my house?\nGold-goddess, now, | if thou wouldst know,\nHeroes' blood | from thy hands hast washed.\"\n\n~<Brynhild spake:~>\n3. \"Chide me not, woman | from rocky walls,\nThough to battle once | I was wont to go;\nBetter than thou | I shall seem to be,\nWhen men us two | shall truly know.\"\n\n~<The giantess spake:~>\n4. \"Thou wast, Brynhild, | Buthli's daughter,\n\n[~<Prose~>. The prose follows the last stanza of ~<Sigurtharkvitha en skamma~> without break. ~<Two~> ~<bale-fires~>: this contradicts the statement made in the concluding stanzas of ~<Sigurtharkvitha~> ~<en~> ~<skamma~>, that Sigurth and Brynhild were burned on the same pyre; there is no evidence that the annotator here had anything but his own mistaken imagination to go on.\n\n2. ~<Valland~>: this name (\"Land of Slaughter\") is used else where of mythical places; cf. ~<Harbarthsljoth~>, 24, and prose introduction to ~<Völundarkvitha~>; it may here not be a proper name at all, ~<Gold-goddess~>: poetic circumlocution for \"woman.\"]",

					"For the worst of evils | born in the world;\nTo death thou hast given | Gjuki's children,\nAnd laid their lofty | house full low.\"\n\n~<Brynhild spake:~>\n5. \"Truth from the wagon | here I tell thee,\nWitless one, | if know thou wilt\nHow the heirs of Gjuki | gave me to be\njoyless ever, | a breaker of oaths.\n\n6. \"Hild the helmed | in Hlymdalir\nThey named me of old, | all they who knew me.\n. . . . .  . . . . .\n. . . . .  . . . . .\n\n7. \"The monarch bold | the swan-robes bore\nOf the sisters eight | beneath an oak;\n\n[6. In ~<Regius~> these two lines stand after stanza 7, but most editions; place them as here. They are not quoted in the ~<Nornageststhattr~>. Presumably two lines, and perhaps more, have been lost. It has frequently been argued that all or part of the passage from stanza 6 through stanza 10 (6-10, 7-10 or 8-10) comes originally from the so-called ~<Sigrdrifumol~>, where it would undoubtedly fit exceedingly well. ~<Hild~>: a Valkyrie name meaning \"Fighter\" (cf. ~<Voluspo~>, 31). in such compound names as Brynhild (\"Fighter in Armor\") the first element was occasionally omitted. ~<Hlymdalir~> (\"Tumult-Dale\"): a mythical name, merely signifying the place of battle as the home of Valkyries.\n\n7. Regarding the identification of swan-maidens with Valkyries, and the manner in which men could get them in their power by stealing their swan-garments, cf. ~<Völundarkvitha~>, introductory prose and note, where the same thing happens. ~<The monarch~>: perhaps Agnar, brother of Autha, mentioned in Sigrdrifumol (prose and quoted verse following stanza 4) as the warrior for]",

					"Twelve winters I was, | if know thou wilt,\nWhen oaths I yielded | the king so young.\n\n8. \"Next I let | the leader of Goths,\nHjalmgunnar the old, | go down to hell,\nAnd victory brought | to Autha's brother;\nFor this was Othin's | anger mighty.\n\n9. \"He beset me with shields | in Skatalund,\nRed and white, | their rims o'erlapped;\nHe bade that my sleep | should broken be\nBy him who fear | had nowhere found.\n\n10. \"He let round my hall, | that southward looked,\nThe branches' foe | high-leaping burn;\nAcross it he bade | the hero come\nWho brought me the gold | that Fafnir guarded\n\n11. On Grani rode | the giver of gold,\n\n[whose sake Brynhild defied Othin in slaying Hjalmgunnar. ~<Eight~>: the ~<Nornageststhattr~> manuscripts have \"sisters of Atli\" instead of \"sisters eight.\"\n\n8. ~<Hjalmgunnar~>: regarding this king of the Goths (the phrase means little) and his battle with Agnar, brother of ~<Autha~> cf. ~<Sigrdrifumol~>, prose after stanza 4. One ~<Nornageststhattr~> manuscript has \"brother of the giantess\" in place of \"leader of Goths.\"\n\n9. Cf. ~<Sigrdrifumol~>, prose introduction. ~<Skatalund~> (\"Warriors' Grove\"): a mythical name; elsewhere the place where Brynhild lay is called Hindarfjoll.\n\n10. ~<Branches' foe~>: fire. Regarding the treasure cf. ~<Fafnismol~>.\n\n11. This stanza is presumably an interpolation, reflecting a different version of the story, wherein Sigurth meets Brynhild at the home of her brother-in-law and foster-father, Heimir (cf.]",

					"Where my foster-father | ruled his folk;\nBest of all | he seemed to be,\nThe prince of the Danes, | when the people met.\n\n12. \"Happy we slept, | one bed we had,\nAs he my brother | born had been;\nEight were the nights | when neither there\nLoving hand | on the other laid.\n\n13. \"Yet Guthrun reproached me, | Gjuki's daughter,\nThat I in Sigurth's | arms had slept;\nThen did I hear | what I would were hid,\nThat they had betrayed me | in taking a mate.\n\n14. \"Ever with grief | and all too long\nAre men and women | born in the world;\nBut yet we shall live | our lives together,\nSigurth and I. | Sink down, Giantess!\"\n\n[~<Gripisspo~>, 19 and 27). ~<Grani~>: Sigurth's horse. ~<Danes~>: nowhere else does Sigurth appear in this capacity. Perhaps this is a curious relic of the Helgi tradition.\n\n12. ~<Eight nights~>: elsewhere (cf. ~<Gripisspo~>, 4.2) the time is stated as three nights, not eight. There is a confusion of traditions here, as in ~<Gripisspo~>. In the version of the story wherein Sigurth met Brynhild before he encountered the Gjukungs, Sigurth was bound by no oaths, and the union was completed; it is only in the alternative version that the episode of the sword laid between the two occurs.\n\n14. The idea apparently conveyed in the concluding lines, that Sigurth and Brynhild will be together in some future life, is utterly out of keeping with the Norse pagan traditions, and the whole stanza indicates the influence of Christianity.]"

					"~<Drap Niflunga~>\n\n~<The Slaying of The Niflungs~>\n\n~<Introductory Note~>\n\nIt has been already pointed out (introductory note to ~<Reginsmol~>) that the compiler of the Eddic collection had clearly undertaken to formulate a coherent narrative of the entire Sigurth cycle, piecing together the various poems by means of prose narrative links. To some extent these links were based on traditions existing outside of the lays themselves, but in the main the material was gathered from the contents of the poems. The short prose passage entitled ~<Drap Niflunga~>, which in the ~<Codex Regius~> immediately follows the ~<Helreith Brynhildar~>, is just such a narrative link, and scarcely deserves a special heading, but as nearly all editions separate it from the preceding and following poems, I have followed their example.\n\nWith Sigurth and Brynhild both dead, the story turns to the slaying of the sons of Gjuki by Atli, Guthrun's second husband, and to a few subsequent incidents, mostly late incorporations from other narrative cycles, including the tragic death of Svanhild, daughter of Sigurth and Guthrun and wife of Jormunrek (Ermanarich), and the exploits of Hamther, son of Guthrun and her third husband, Jonak. These stories are told, or outlined, in the two Atli lays, the second and third Guthrun lays, the ~<Oddrunargratr~>, the ~<Guthrunarhvot~>, and the ~<Hamthesmol~>. Had the compiler seen fit to put the Atli lays immediately after the ~<Helreith Brynhildar~>, he would have needed only a very brief transitional note to make the course of the story clear, but as the second Guthrun lay, the next poem in the collection, is a lament following the death of Guthrun's brothers, some sort of a narrative bridge was manifestly needed.\n\n~<Drap Niflunga~> is based entirely on the poems which follow it in the collection, with no use of extraneous material. The part of the story which it summarizes belongs to the semi-historical Burgundian tradition (cf. introductory note to ~<Gripisspo~>), in many respects parallel to the familiar narrative of the Nibelungenlied, and, except in minor details, showing few essentially Northern additions. Sigurth is scarcely mentioned, and the outstanding episode is the slaying of Gunnar and Hogni, following their journey to Atli's home.",

					"__________________\n\nGunnar and Hogni then took all the gold that Fafnir had had. There was strife between the Gjukungs and Atli, for he held the Gjukungs guilty of Brynhild's death. It was agreed that they should give him Guthrun as wife, and they gave her a draught of forgetfulness to drink before she would consent to be wedded to Atli. The sons of Atli were Erp and Eitil, and Svanhild was the daughter of Sigurth and Guthrun. King Atli invited Gunnar and Hogni to come to him, and sent as messenger Vingi or Knefröth. Guthrun was aware of treachery, and sent with him a message in runes that they should not come, and as a token she sent to Hogni the ring Andvaranaut and tied a wolf's hair in it. Gunnar had sought Oddrun, Atli's sister, for his wife, but had her not; then he married Glaumvor, and Hogni's wife was\n\n[~<Prose~>. ~<Niflungs~>: regarding the mistaken application of this name to the sons of Gjuki, who were Burgundians, cf. ~<Brot~>, 17 and note. ~<Draught of forgetfulness~>: according to the ~<Volsungasaga~> Grimhild, Guthrun's mother, administered this, just as she did the similar draught which made Sigurth forget Brynhild. ~<Erp and Eitil:~> Guthrun kills her two sons by Atli as part of her revenge; the annotator here explains her act further by saying that Guthrun asked her sons to intercede with their father in favor of Guthrun's brothers, but that they refused, a detail which he appears to have invented, as it is found nowhere else. ~<Svanhild~>: cf. ~<Sigurtharkvitha en skamma~>, 54 and note. ~<Vingi~> or ~<Knefröth~>: ~<Atlakvitha~> (stanza 1) calls the messenger Knefröth; ~<Atlamol~> (stanza 4) speaks of two messengers, but names only one of them, Vingi. The annotator has here tried, unsuccessfully, to combine the two accounts. ~<Andvaranaut~>: regarding the origin of Andvari's ring cf. ~<Reginsmol~>, prose after stanzas 4 and 5 and notes; Sigurth gave the ring to Guthrun. Here again the annotator is combining two stories; in ~<Atlakvitha~> (stanza 8) Guthrun sends a ring (not Andvaranaut) with a wolf's hair; in ~<Atlamol~> (stanza 4) she sends a message written]",

					"Kostbera; their sons were Solar and Snævar and Gjuki. And when the Gjukungs came to Atli, then Guthrun be sought her sons to plead for the lives of both the Gjukungs, but they would not do it. Hogni's heart was cut out, and Gunnar was cast into the serpent's den. He smote on the harp and put the serpents to sleep, but an adder stung him in the liver.\n\n[in runes. The messenger obscures these runes, and Kostbera, Hogni's wife, who attempts to decipher them, is not clear as to their meaning, though she suspects danger. ~<Oddrun~>: cf. ~<Sigurtharkvitha en skamma~>, 57 and note. ~<Glaumvor~>: almost nothing is told of Gunnar's second wife, though she appears frequently in the ~<Atlamol~>. ~<Kostbera~> (or Bera), Hogni's wife, is known only as skilled in runes. Her brother was Orkning. The sons of Hogni and Kostbera, according to the ~<Atlamol~> (stanza 28), were ~<Solar~> and ~<Snævar~>; the third son, ~<Gjuki~>, named after his grandfather, seems to be an invention of the annotator's. ~<Adder~>: according to ~<Oddrunargratr~> (stanza 30) Atli's mother assumed this form in order to complete her son's vengeance.]"

					"~<Guthrunarkvitha II, En Forna~>\n\n~<The Second, or Old, Lay of Guthrun~>\n\n~<Introductory Note~>\n\nIt has already been pointed out (introductory note to ~<Guthrunarkvitha I~>) that the tradition of Guthrun's lament was known wherever the Sigurth story existed, and that this lament was probably one of the earliest parts of the legend to assume verse form. Whether it reached the North as verse cannot, of course, be determined, but it is at least possible that this was the case, and in any event it is clear that by the tenth and eleventh centuries there were a number of Norse poems with Guthrun's lament as the central theme. Two of these are included in the Eddic collection, the second one being unquestionably much the older. It is evidently the poem referred to by the annotator in the prose note following the ~<Brot~> as \"the old Guthrun lay,\" and its character and state of preservation have combined to lead most commentators to date it as early as the first half of the tenth century, whereas ~<Guthrunarkvitha I~> belongs a hundred years later.\n\nThe poem has evidently been preserved in rather bad shape, with a number of serious omissions and some interpolations, but in just this form it lay before the compilers of the ~<Volsungasaga~>, who paraphrased it faithfully, and quoted five of its stanzas. The interpolations are on the whole unimportant; the omissions, while they obscure the sense of certain passages, do not destroy the essential continuity of the poem, in which Guthrun reviews her sorrows from the death of Sigurth through the slaying of her brothers to Atli's dreams foretelling the death of their sons. It is, indeed, the only Norse poem of the Sigurth cycle antedating the year 1000 which has come down to us in anything approaching complete form; the ~<Reginsmol~>, ~<Fafnismol~>, and ~<Sigrdrifumol~> are all collections of fragments, only a short bit of the \"long\" Sigurth lay remains, and the others--~<Gripisspo~>, ~<Guthrunarkvitha I~> and ~<III~>, ~<Sigurtharkvitha en skamma~>, ~<Helreith Brynhildar~>, ~<Oddrunargratr~>, ~<Guthrunarhvot~>, ~<Hamthesmol~>, and the two Atli lays--are all generally dated from the eleventh and even the twelfth centuries.\n\nAn added reason for believing that ~<Guthrunarkvitha II~> traces its origin back to a lament which reached the North",

					"from Germany in verse form is the absence of most characteristic Norse additions to the narrative, except in minor details. Sigurth is slain in the forest, as \"German men say\" (cf. ~<Brot~>, concluding prose); the urging of Guthrun by her mother 2nd brothers to become Atli's wife, the slaying of the Gjukungs (here only intimated, for at that point something seems to have been lost), and Guthrun's prospective revenge on Atli, all belong directly to the German tradition (cf. introductory note to ~<Gripisspo~>).\n\nIn the ~<Codex Regius~> the poem is entitled simply ~<Guthrunarkvitha~>; the numeral has been added in nearly all editions to distinguish this poem from the other two Guthrun lays, and the phrase \"the old\" is borrowed from the annotator's comment in the prose note at the end of the ~<Brot~>.\n\n__________________\n\nKing Thjothrek was with Atli, and had lost most of his men. Thjothrek and Guthrun lamented their griefs together. She spoke to him, saying:\n\n1.

The German tradition early accepted the anachronism of bringing together Attila (Etzel, Atli), who died in 453, and Theoderich. who was born about 455, and adding thereto Ermanarich (Jormunrek), king of the Goths, who died about 376. Ermanarich, in German tradition, replaced Theoderich's actual enemy, Odovakar, and it was in battle with Jormunrek (i. e., Odovakar) that Thjothrek is here said to have lost most WE his men. The annotator found the material for this note in ~<Guthrunarkvitha III~>, in which Guthrun is accused of having Thjothrek as her lover. At the time when ~<Guthrunarkvitha II~>]",

A Thora appears in ~<Hyndluljoth~>, 18, as the wife of Dag, one of the sons of Halfdan the Old, the most famous of Denmark's mythical kings, and one of her sons is Alf (Hoalf?).]",

The ~<Volsungasaga~> paraphrase indicates that these two lines are the remains of a full stanza, the prose passage running: \"Now Guthrun was some what comforted of her sorrows. Then Grimhild learned where Guthrun was now dwelling.\" The first two lines may be the ones missing. ~<Gothic~>: the term \"Goth\" was used in the North without much discrimination to apply to all south-Germanic peoples. In ~<Gripisspo~>, 35, Gunnar, Grimhild's son, appears as \"lord of the Goths.\"\n\n18. The manuscript marks line 3 as the beginning of a stanza. Grimhild is eager to have amends made to Guthrun for the slaying of Sigurth and their son, Sigmund, because Atli has threatened war if he cannot have Guthrun for his wife.\n\n19. Lines 5-6 are almost certainly interpolations, made by a scribe with a very vague understanding of the meaning of the stanza, which refers simply to the journey of the Gjukungs to bring their sister home from Denmark.\n\n20. Lines 1-2 are probably interpolated, though the ~<Volsungasaga~> includes the names. Some one apparently attempted to]",

Some commentators assume, as the Volsungasaga does, that these messengers went with the Gjukungs to Denmark in search of Guthrun, but it seems more likely that a transitional stanza has dropped out after stanza 19, and that Guthrun received Atli's emissaries in her brothers' home. ~<Long-beards~>: the word may actually mean Langobards or Lombards, but, if it does, it is presumably without any specific significance here. Certainly the names in the interpolated two lines do not fit either Lombards or Huns, for Valdar is identified as a Dane, and Jarizleif and Jarizskar are apparently Slavic. The manuscript indicates line 5 as beginning a new stanza.\n\n21. ~<Each~>: the reference is presumably to Gunnar and Hogni, and perhaps also Grimhild, I suspect that this stanza belongs before stanza 20.\n\n22. Stanzas 22-25 describe the draught of forgetfulness which Grimhild gives Guthrun, just as she gave one to Sigurth (in one version of the story) to make him forget Brynhild. The draught does not seem to work despite Guthrun's statement in stanza 25 (cf. stanza 30), for which reason Vigfusson, not unwisely, places stanzas 22-25 after stanza 34. ~<Blood~> ~<of~> ~<swine~>: cf. ~<Hyndluljoth~>, 39 and note.]",

It is possible that the comma should follow \"heather fish,\" making the \"ear uncut\" (of grain) come from the world of the dead.\n\n24. ~<Dew of the hearth~>: soot.\n\n25. In the manuscript, and in some editions, the first line is in the third person plural: \"Then they forgot, when the draught they had drunk.\" The second line in the original is manifestly in bad shape, and has been variously emended. I forgot: this emendation is doubtful, in view of stanza 30, but cf. note to stanza 22. The kings all three: probably Atli's emissaries, though the interpolated lines of stanza 20 name four of them.

But some editions omit the \"thy,\" and if Atli, and not Grimhild, is speaking (cf. note on stanza 25), the reference may be, as in line 3 of stanza 27, to the wealth of Atli's father, Buthli. ~<Hlothver~>: the northern form of the Frankish name Chlodowech (Ludwig), but who this Hlothver was, beyond the fact that he was evidently a Frankish king, is uncertain. If Atli is speaking, he is presumably a Frankish ruler whose land Atli and his Huns have conquered.\n\n27. Cf. note on stanza 25 as to the probable speaker.\n\n28. In stanzas 28-32 the dialogue, in alternate stanzas, is clearly between Guthrun and her mother, Grimhild, though the manuscript does not indicate the speakers.]",

This stanza presents a strong argument for transposing the description of the draught of forgetfulness (stanzas 22-24 and lines 1-2 of stanza 25) to follow stanza 33. ~<Raven~>, etc.: the original is somewhat obscure, and the line may refer simply to the \"corpse-eating raven.\" 32. In the manuscript this stanza is immediately followed by the two lines which here, following Bugge's suggestion, appear]",

If stanza 35 really belongs here, it continues the prophesy to the effect that Guthrun will have no rest till she has avenged her brothers' death.\n\n33. Very likely the remains of two stanzas; the manuscript marks line 4 as beginning a new stanza. On the other band, lines 3 and 5 may be interpolations. ~<Vinbjorg~> and ~<Valbjorg~>: apparently imaginary place-names.\n\n34. ~<The kings~>: presumably Gunnar and Hogni. ~<My sons~>: regarding Guthrun's slaying of her two sons by Atli, Erp and Eitil, cf. ~<Drap Niflunga~>, note.\n\n35. In the manuscript this stanza follows stanza 32. The loss of two lines, to the effect that \"Ill was that marriage for my brothers, and ill for Atli himself,\" and the transposition of the remaining two lines to this point, are indicated in a number of editions. ~<The~> ~<warrior~>, etc.: Atli, whom Guthrun kills.]",

Line 5, which the manuscript marks as be ginning a stanza, is probably spurious.\n\n37. After these two lines there appears to be a considerable gap, the lost stanzas giving Guthrun's story of the slaying of her brothers. It is possible that stanzas 38-45 came originally from another poem, dealing with Atli's dream, and were here substituted for the original conclusion of Guthrun's lament. Many editions combine stanzas 37 and 38, or combine stanza 38 (the manuscript marks line I as beginning a stanza) with lines 1-2 of stanza 39.\n\n39. The manuscript indicates line 3 as the beginning of a stanza. The manuscript and most editions do not indicate the speakers in this and the following stanzas.]",

					"~<Guthrun spake:~>\n40. \"Fire a dream | of steel shall follow\nAnd willful pride | one of woman's wrath;\nA baneful sore | I shall burn from thee,\nAnd tend and heal thee, | though hated thou am\"\n\n~<Atli spake:~>\n41. \"Of plants I dreamed, | in the garden drooping,\nThat fain would I have | full high to grow;\nPlucked by the roots, | and red with blood,\nThey brought them hither, | and bade me eat.\n\n42. \"I dreamed my hawks | from my hand had flown,\nEager for food, | to an evil house;\nI dreamed their hearts | with honey I ate,\nSoaked in blood, | and heavy my sorrow.\n\n43. \"Hounds I dreamed | from my hand I loosed,\nLoud in hunger | and pain they howled;\nTheir flesh methought | was eagles' food,\nAnd their bodies now | I needs must eat.\"\n\n~<Guthrun spake:~>\n44. \"Men shall soon | of sacrifice speak,\n\n[40. Guthrun, somewhat obscurely, interprets Atli's first dream (stanza 39) to mean that she will cure him of an abscess by cauterizing it. Her interpretation is, of course, intended merely to blind him to her purpose.\n\n41. In stanzas 41-43 Atli's dreams forecast the death of his two sons, whose flesh Guthrun gives him to eat (cf. ~<Atlakvitha~>, 39, and ~<Atlamol~>, 78).\n\n44. This stanza is evidently Guthrun's intentionally cryptic]",

					"And off the heads | of beasts shall hew\nDie they shall | ere day has dawned,\nA few nights hence, | and the folk shall have them.\"\n\n~<Atli spake:~>\n45. \"On my bed I sank, | nor slumber sought,\nWeary with woe,-- | full well I remember.\n. . . . .  . . . . .\n\n[interpretation of Atli's dreams, but the meaning of the original is more than doubtful. The word here rendered \"sacrifice\" may mean \"sea-catch,\" and the one rendered \"beasts\" may mean \"whales.\" None of the attempted emendations have rendered the stanza really intelligible, but it appears to mean that Atli will soon make a sacrifice of beasts at night, and give their bodies to the people. Guthrun of course has in mind the slaying of his two sons.\n\n45. With these two lines the poem abruptly ends; some editors assign the speech to Atli (I think rightly), others to Guthrun. Ettmüller combines the lines with stanza 38. Whether stanzas 38-45 originally belonged to Guthrun's lament, or were interpolated here in place of the lost conclusion of that poem from another one dealing with Atli's dreams (cf. note on stanza 37), it is clear that the end has been lost.]"

					"~<Guthrunarkvitha III~>\n\n~<The Third Lay of Guthrun~>\n\n~<Introductory Note~>\n\nThe short ~<Guthrunarkvitha III~>, entitled in the manuscript simply Guthrunarkvitha, but so numbered in most editions to distinguish it from the first and second Guthrun lays, appears only in the ~<Codex Regius~>. It is neither quoted nor paraphrased in the ~<Volsungasaga~>, the compilers of which appear not to have known the story with which it deals. The poem as we have it is evidently complete and free from serious interpolations. It can safely be dated from the first half of the eleventh century, for the ordeal by boiling water, with which it is chiefly concerned, was first introduced into Norway by St. Olaf, who died in 1030, and the poem speaks of it in stanza 7 as still of foreign origin.\n\nThe material for the poem evidently came from North Germany, but there is little indication that the poet was working on the basis of a narrative legend already fully formed. The story of the wife accused of faithlessness who proves her innocence by the test of boiling water had long been current in Germany, as elsewhere, and had attached itself to various women of legendary fame, but not except in this poem, so far as we can judge, to Guthrun (Kriemhild). The introduction of Thjothrek (Theoderich, Dietrich, Thithrek) is another indication of relative lateness, for the legends of Theoderich do not appear to have reached the North materially before the year 1000. On the anachronism of bringing Thjothrek to Atli's court cf. ~<Guthrunarkvitha II~>, introductory prose, note, in which the development of the Theoderich tradition in its relation to that of Atli is briefly outlined.\n\n~<Guthrunarkvitha III~> is, then, little more than a dramatic German story made into a narrative lay by a Norse poet, with the names of Guthrun, Atli, Thjothrek, and Herkja incorporated for the sake of greater effectiveness. Its story probably nowhere formed a part of the living tradition of Sigurth and Atli, but the poem has so little distinctively Norse coloring that it may Possibly have been based on a story or even a poem which its composer heard in Germany or from the lips of a German narrator.",

					"__________________\n\nHerkja was the name of a serving-woman of Atli's; she had been his concubine. She told Atli that she had seen Thjothrek and Guthrun both together. Atli was greatly angered thereby. Then Guthrun said:\n\n1. \"What thy sorrow, Atli, | Buthli's son?\nIs thy heart heavy-laden? | Why laughest thou never?\nIt would better befit | the warrior far\nTo speak with men, | and me to look on.\"\n\n~<Atli spake:~>\n2. \"It troubles me, Guthrun, | Gjuki's daughter,\nWhat Herkja here | in the hall hath told me,\nThat thou in the bed | with Thjothrek liest,\nBeneath the linen | in lovers' guise.\"\n\n~<Guthrun spake:~>\n3. \"This shall I | with oaths now swear,\nSwear by the sacred | stone so white,\nThat nought was there | with Thjothmar's son\nThat man or woman | may not know.\n\n[~<Prose~>. The annotator derived all the material for this note from the poem itself, except for the reference to Herkja as Atli's former concubine. ~<Herkja~>: the historical Kreka and the Helche of the ~<Nibelungenlied~>, who there appears as Etzel's (Attila's) first wife. ~<Thjothrek~>: cf. Introductory Note.\n\n2. The manuscript omits the names of the speakers through out.\n\n3. ~<Holy stone~>: just what this refers to is uncertain; it may be identical with the \"ice-cold stone of Uth\" mentioned in an oath in ~<Helgakvitha Hundingsbana II~>, 29. ~<Thjothmar's son~>: the manuscript has simply \"Thjothmar.\" Some editions change it as]",

Regarding the death of Thjothrek's men cf. ~<Guthrunarkvitha II~>, introductory prose, note. It was on these stanzas of ~<Guthrunarkvitha III~> that the annotator based his introduction to ~<Guthrunarkvitha II~>. The manuscript repeats the \"thirty\" in line 2, in defiance of metrical requirements.\n\n6. In the manuscript this stanza follows stanza 7; many editions have made the transposition.\n\n7. Who Saxi may be is not clear, but the stanza clearly points to the time when the ordeal by boiling water was still regarded as a foreign institution, and when a southern king (i. e., a Christian from some earlier-converted region) was necessary]",

To the bottom she reached | with hand so bright,\nAnd forth she brought | the flashing stones:\n\"Behold, ye warriors, | well am I cleared\nOf sin by the kettle's | sacred boiling.\"\n\n9. Then Atli's heart | in happiness laughed,\nWhen Guthrun's hand | unhurt he saw;\n\"Now Herkja shall come | the kettle to try,\nShe who grief | for Guthrun planned.\"\n\n10. Ne'er saw man sight | more sad than this,\nHow burned were the hands | of Herkja then;\nIn a bog so foul | the maid they flung,\nAnd so was Guthrun's | grief requited.\n\n[to consecrate the kettle used in the test. The ordeal by boiling water followed closely the introduction of Christianity, which took place around the year 1000. Some editions make two stanzas out of stanza 7, and Müllenhoff contends that lines 1-2 do not constitute part of Guthrun's speech.\n\n10. The word \"requited\" in line 4 is omitted in the manuscript, but it is clear that some such word was intended. The punishment of casting a culprit into a bog to be drowned was particularly reserved for women, and is not infrequently mentioned in the sagas.]"

					"~<Oddrunargratr~>\n\n~<The Lament of Oddrun~>\n\n~<Introductory Note~>\n\nThe ~<Oddrunargratr~> follows ~<Guthrunarkvitha III~> in the ~<Codex Regius~>; it is not quoted or mentioned elsewhere, except that the composer of the \"short\" Sigurth lay seems to have been familiar with it. The ~<Volsungasaga~> says nothing of the story on which it is based, and mentions Oddrun only once, in the course of its paraphrase of Brynhild's prophecy from the \"short\" Sigurth lay. That the poem comes from the eleventh century is generally agreed; prior to the year 1000 there is no trace of the figure of Oddrun, Atli's sister, and yet the ~<Oddrunargratr~> is almost certainly older than the \"short\" Sigurth lay, so that the last half of the eleventh century seems to be a fairly safe guess.\n\nWhere or how the figure of Oddrun entered the Sigurth-Atli cycle is uncertain. She does not appear in any of the extant German versions, and it is generally assumed that she was a creation of the North, though the poet refers to \"old tales\" concerning her. She does not directly affect the course of the story at all, though the poet has used effectively the episode of Gunnar's death, with the implication that Atli's vengeance on Gunnar and Hogni was due, at least in part, to his discovery of Gunnar's love affair with Oddrun. The material which forms the background of Oddrun's story belongs wholly to the German part of the legend (cf. introductory note to ~<Gripisspo~>), and is paralleled with considerable closeness in the ~<Nibelungenlied~>; only Oddrun herself and the subsidiary figures of Borgny and Vilmund are Northern additions. The geography, on the other hand, is so utterly chaotic as to indicate that the original localization of the Atli story had lost all trace of significance by the time this poem was composed.\n\nIn the manuscript the poem, or rather the brief introductory prose note, bears the heading \"Of Borgny and Oddrun,\" but nearly all editions, following late paper manuscripts, have given the poem the title it bears here. Outside of a few apparently defective stanzas, and some confusing transpositions, the Poem has clearly been preserved in good condition, and the beginning and end are definitely marked.",

					"__________________\n\nHeithrek was the name of a king, whose daughter was called Borgny. Vilmund was the name of the man who was her lover. She could not give birth to a child until Oddrun, Atli's sister, had come to her; Oddrun had been beloved of Gunnar, son of Gjuki. About this story is the following poem.\n\n1. I have heard it told | in olden tales\nHow a maiden came | to Morningland;\nNo one of all | on earth above\nTo Heithrek's daughter | help could give.\n\n2. This Oddrun learned, | the sister of Atli,\nThat sore the maiden's | sickness was;\nThe bit-bearer forth | from his stall she brought,\nAnd the saddle laid | on the steed so black.\n\n3. She let the horse go | o'er the level ground,\nTill she reached the hall | that loftily rose,\n\n[~<Prose~>. Nothing further is known of ~<Heithrek~>, ~<Borgny~> or ~<Vilmund~>. The annotator has added the name of Borgny's father, but otherwise his material comes from the poem itself. ~<Oddrun~>, sister of Atli and Brynhild, here appears as proficient in birth runes (cf. ~<Sigrdrifumol~>, 8). Regarding her love for Gunnar, Guthrun's brother, and husband of her sister, Brynhild, cf. ~<Sigurtharkvitha en skamma~>, 57 and note.\n\n1. ~<Olden tales~>: this may be merely a stock phrase, or it may really mean that the poet found his story in oral prose tradition. ~<Morningland~>: the poem's geography is utterly obscure. \"Morningland\" is apparently identical with \"Hunland\" (stanza 4), and yet Oddrun is herself sister of the king of the Huns. Vigfusson tries to make \"Mornaland\" into \"Morva land\" and explain it as Moravia. Probably it means little more than a country lying vaguely in the East. With stanza 28 the confusion grows worse.]",

					"(And in she went | from the end of the hall;)\nFrom the weary steed | the saddle she took;\nHear now the speech | that first she spake:\n\n4. \"What news on earth, |  . . . . .\nOr what has happened | in Hunland now?\"\n\n~<A serving-maid spake:~>\n\"Here Borgny lies | in bitter pain,\nThy friend, and, Oddrun, | thy help would find.\"\n\n~<Oddrun spake:~>\n5. 'Who worked this woe | for the woman thus,\nOr why so sudden | is Borgny sick?\"\n\n~<The serving-maid spake:~>\n\"Vilmund is he, | the heroes' friend,\nWho wrapped the woman | in bedclothes warm,\n(For winters five, | yet her father knew not).\"\n\n6. Then no more | they spake, methinks;\nShe went at the knees | of the woman to sit;\n\n[3. Line 3 (cf. ~<Völundarkvitha~>, 17) or line 5 (cf. ~<Thrymskvitha~>, 2), both quoted from older poems, is probably spurious; the manuscript marks line 3 as the beginning of a new stanza.\n\n4. Line 1 in the original appears to have lost its second half. In line 2 the word rendered \"has happened\" is doubtful. The manuscript does not indicate the speaker of lines 3-4, and a few editors assign them to Borgny herself.\n\n5. The manuscript does not indicate the speakers. ~<For the woman~>: conjectural; the manuscript has instead: \"What warrior now hath worked this woe?\" The manuscript indicates line 3 as beginning a new stanza. Line 5, apparently modeled on line, 4 of stanza n, is probably spurious.]",

					"With magic Oddrun | and mightily Oddrun\nChanted for Borgny | potent charms.\n\n7. At last were born | a boy and girl,\nSon and daughter | of Hogni's slayer;\nThen speech the woman | so weak began,\nNor said she aught | ere this she spake:\n\n8. \"So may the holy | ones thee help,\nFrigg and Freyja | and favoring gods,\nAs thou hast saved me | from sorrow now.\"\n\n~<Oddrun spake:~>\n9. \"I came not hither | to help thee thus\nBecause thou ever | my aid didst earn;\nI fulfilled the oath | that of old I swore,\nThat aid to all | I should ever bring,\n(When they shared the wealth | the warriors had).\"\n\n[6. Charms: cf. ~<Sigrdrifumol~>, 8.\n\n7. ~<Hogni's slayer~>: obviously Vilmund, but unless he was the one of Atli's followers who actually cut out Hogni's heart (cf. ~<Drap Niflunga~>), there is nothing else to connect him with Hogni's death. Sijmons emends the line to read \"Born of the sister | of Hogni's slayer.\"'\n\n8. Regarding ~<Frigg~> as a goddess of healing cf. ~<Svipdagsmol~>, 52, note. Regarding ~<Freyja~> as the friend of lovers cf. ~<Grimnismol~>, 14, note. A line is very possibly missing from this stanza.\n\n9. The manuscript does not name the speaker. In line 2 the word rendered \"earn\" is omitted in the manuscript, but nearly all editions have supplied it. Line 5 is clearly either interpolated or out of place. It may be all that is left of a stanza which stood between stanzas 15 and 16, or it may belong in stanza 12.]",

					"~<Borgny spake:~>\n10. \"Wild art thou, Oddrun, | and witless now,\nThat so in hatred | to me thou speakest;\nI followed thee | where thou didst fare,\nAs we had been born | of brothers twain.\"\n\n~<Oddrun spake:~>\n11. \"I remember the evil | one eve thou spakest,\nWhen a draught I gave | to Gunnar then;\nThou didst say that never | such a deed\nBy maid was done | save by me alone.\"\n\n12. Then the sorrowing woman | sat her down\nTo tell the grief | of her troubles great.\n\n[10-20. In the manuscript the order is as follows: 12; 13; 14; 15, 3-4; 10; 11; 16; 17; 15; 19, 1-2; 19, 1-2; 19, 3-4; 20. The changes made here, following several of the editions, are: (a) the transposition of stanzas 10-11, which are clearly dialogue, out of the body of the lament to a position just before it; (b) the transposition of lines 1-2 of stanza 15 to their present position from the middle of stanza 19.\n\n10. The manuscript does not name the speaker; cf. note on stanzas 10-20.\n\n11. The manuscript does not name the speaker; cf. note on stanzas 10-20. The word rendered \"evil\" in line 1 is a conjectural addition. Apparently Borgny was present at Atli's court while the love affair between Oddrun and Gunnar was in progress, and criticised Oddrun for her part in it. ~<A draught~>, etc.: apparently in reference to a secret meeting of the lovers.\n\n12. In the manuscript this stanza follows stanza 9; cf. note on stanzas 10-20. No gap is indicated, but something has presumably been lost. Grundtvig supplies as a first line: \"The maid her evil days remembered,\" and inserts as a second line line 5 of stanza 9.]",

					"13. \"Happy I grew | in the hero's hall\nAs the warriors wished, | and they loved me well;\nGlad I was | of my father's gifts,\nFor winters five, | while my father lived.\n\n14. \"These were the words | the weary king,\nEre he died, | spake last of all:\nHe bade me with red gold | dowered to be,\nAnd to Grimhild's son | in the South be wedded.\n\n15. \"But Brynhild the helm | he bade to wear,\nA wish-maid bright | he said she should be;\nFor a nobler maid | would never be born\nOn earth, he said, | if death should spare her.\n\n16. \"At her weaving Brynhild | sat in her bower,\nLands and folk | alike she had;\n\n[13. The manuscript indicates line 3 as the beginning of a new stanza; many editions combine lines 1-2 with stanza 12 and lines 3-4 with lines 1-2 of stanza 14. ~<The hero~>: Buthli, father of Oddrun, Atli, and Brynhild.\n\n14. The manuscript indicates line 3, but not line 1, as the beginning of a new stanza; some editions combine lines 3-4 with lines 3-4 of stanza 15. Making Buthli plan the marriage of Oddrun and Gunnar may be a sheer invention of the poet, or may point to an otherwise lost version of the legend.\n\n15. Lines 1-2 have here been transposed from the middle of stanza 19; cf. note on stanzas 10-20. ~<Wish-maid~>: a Valkyrie, so called because the Valkyries fullfilled Othin's wish in choosing the slain heroes for Valhall. The reference to Brynhild as a Valkyrie by no means fits with the version of the story used in stanzas 16-17, and the poet seems to have attempted to combine the two contradictory traditions, cf. ~<Fafnismol~>, note on stanza 44. In the manuscript stanzas 10-11 follow line 4 of stanza 15.]",

					"The earth and heaven | high resounded\nWhen Fafnir's slayer | the city saw.\n\n17. \"Then battle was fought | with the foreign swords,\nAnd the city was broken | that Brynhild had;\nNot long thereafter, | but all too soon,\nTheir evil wiles | full well she knew.\n\n18. \"Woeful for this | her vengeance was,\nAs so we learned | to our sorrow all;\nIn every land | shall all men hear\nHow herself at Sigurth's | side she slew.\n\n19. \"Love to Gunnar | then I gave,\nTo the breaker of rings, | as Brynhild might;\nTo Atli rings | so red they offered,\nAnd mighty gifts | to my brother would give.\n\n[16. In stanzas 16-17 the underlying story seems to be the one used in ~<Sigurtharkvitha~> ~<en~> ~<skamma~> (particularly stanzas 32-39), and referred to in ~<Guthrunarkvitha I~>, 24, wherein Gunnar and Sigurth lay siege to Atli's city (it here appears as Brynhild's) and are bought off only by Atli's giving Brynhild to Gunnar as wife, winning her consent thereto by falsely representing to her that Gunnar is Sigurth. This version is, of course, utterly at variance with the one in which Sigurth wins Brynhild for Gunnar by riding through the ring of flames, and is probably more closely akin to the early German traditions. In the ~<Nibelungenlied~> Brynhild appears as a queen ruling over lands and peoples. ~<Fafnir's slayer~>: Sigurth.\n\n17. Cf. note on preceding stanza.\n\n19. Cf. ~<Sigurtharkvitha~> ~<en~> ~<skamma~>, stanzas 64-70.\n\n19. In the manuscript lines 1-2 of stanza 15 follow line 2, resulting in various conjectural combinations. The manuscript marks line 3 as beginning a new stanza. ~<Rings~>, etc.: possibly, as]",

					"20. \"Fifteen dwellings | fain would he give\nFor me, and the burden | that Grani bore;\nBut Atli said | he would never receive\nMarriage gold | from Gjuki's son.\n\n21. \"Yet could we not | our love o'ercome,\nAnd my head I laid | on the hero's shoulder;\nMany there were | of kinsmen mine\nWho said that together | us they had seen.\n\n22. \"Atli said | that never I\nWould evil plan, | or ill deed do;\nBut none may this | of another think,\nOr surely speak, | when love is shared.\n\n23. \"Soon his men | did Atli send,\nIn the murky wood | on me to spy;\nThither they came | where they should not come,\nWhere beneath one cover | close we lay.\n\n24. \"To the warriors ruddy | rings we offered,\nThat nought to Atli | e'er they should say;\n\n[Gering maintains, payment offered by Gunnar and Hogni for Brynhild's death, but more probably, as in stanza 20, Gunnar's proffered \"marriage gold\" for the hand of Oddrun.\n\n20. ~<Grani's burden~>: the treasure won by Sigurth from Fafnir; cf. ~<Fafnismol~>, concluding prose. The manuscript marks line 3 as beginning a new stanza, as also in stanzas 21 and 22.\n\n23. ~<Murky wood~>: the forest which divided Atli's realm from that of the Gjukungs is in ~<Atlakvitha~>, 3, called Myrkwood. This hardly accords with the extraordinary geography of stanzas 28-29, or with the journey described in ~<Guthrunarkvitha II~>, 36.]",

					"But swiftly home | they hastened thence,\nAnd eager all | to Atli told.\n\n25. \"But close from Guthrun | kept they hid\nWhat first of all | she ought to have known.\n. . . . .  . . . . .\n. . . . .  . . . . .\n\n26. \"Great was the clatter | of gilded hoofs\nWhen Gjuki's sons | through the gateway rode;\nThe heart they hewed | from Hogni then,\nAnd the other they cast | in the serpents' cave.\n\n27. \"The hero wise | on his harp then smote,\n. . . . .  . . . . .\nFor help from me | in his heart yet hoped\nThe high-born king, | might come to him.\n\n[24. In the manuscript lines 3 and 4 stand in reversed order.\n\n25. No gap is indicated in the manuscript; some editors assume the loss not only of two lines, but of an additional stanza. Evidently ~<Guthrun~> has already become Atli's wife.\n\n26. If a stanza has been lost after stanza 25, it may well have told of Atli's treacherous invitation to the Gjukungs to visit him; cf. ~<Drap Niflunga~>, which likewise tells of the slaying of ~<Hogni~> and Gunnar (~<the other~>).\n\n27. In the manuscript these three lines follow line 2 of stanza 28. No gap is indicated in the manuscript, In the ~<Volsungasaga~> Guthrun gives her brother the harp, with which he puts the serpents to sleep. The episode is undoubtedly related to the famous thirtieth Aventiure of the ~<Nibelungenlied~>, in which Volker plays the followers of Gunther to sleep before the final battle.]",

					"28. \"Alone was I gone | to Geirmund then,\nThe draught to mix | and ready to make;\nSudden I heard | from Hlesey clear\nHow in sorrow the strings | of the harp resounded.\n\n29. \"I bade the serving-maids | ready to be,\nFor I longed the hero's | life to save;\nAcross the sound | the boats we sailed,\nTill we saw the whole | of Atli's home.\n\n30. \"Then crawling the evil | woman came,\nAtli's mother-- | may she ever rot!\n\n[28. In the manuscript the three lines of stanza 27 follow line 2, and line 3 is marked as beginning a new stanza. ~<Geirmund~>: nothing further is known of him, but he seems to be an ally or retainer of Atli, or possibly his brother. ~<Hlesey~>: the poet's geography is here in very bad shape. Hlesey is (or may be) the Danish island of Läsö, in the Kattegat (cf. ~<Harbarthsljoth~>, 37 and note), and thither he has suddenly transported not only Gunnar's death-place but Atli's whole dwelling (cf. stanza 29), despite his previous references to the ride to Hunland (stanzas 3-4) and the \"murky wood\" (stanza 23). Geirmund's home, where Oddrun has gone, is separated from Hlesey and Atli's dwelling by a sound (stanza 29). However, geographical accuracy is seldom to be looked for in heroic epic poetry.\n\n29. Many editions combine this stanza with lines 3-4 of stanza 28. ~<The sound:~> cf. note on stanza 28.\n\n30. The manuscript marks line 3 as beginning a new stanza. ~<Atli's mother~>: the ~<Volsungasaga~> does not follow this version; Gunnar puts all the serpents but one to sleep with his harp playing, \"but a mighty and evil adder crawled to him and drove his fangs into him till they reached his heart, and so he died.\" It is possible that \"Atli\" is a scribal error for a word meaning \"of serpents.\"]",

					"And hard she bit | to Gunnar's heart,\nSo I could not help | the hero brave.\n\n31. \"Oft have I wondered | how after this,\nSerpents'-bed goddess! | I still might live,\nFor well I loved | the warrior brave,\nThe giver of swords, | as my very self.\n\n32. \"Thou didst see and listen, | the while I said\nThe mighty grief | that was mine and theirs;\nEach man lives | as his longing wills,--\nOddrun's lament | is ended now.\"\n\n[31. ~<Serpents'-bed goddess~>: woman (i. e., Borgny); \"goddess of gold\" was a frequent term for a woman, and gold was often called the \"serpents' bed\" (cf. ~<Guthrunarkvitha I~>, 24 and note).\n\n32. Some editions make line 4 a statement of the poet's, and not part of Oddrun's speech.]"

Midgar trembled and the heavens were disturbed. In Asgard the gods heard the dread clamour and the strong walls shivered as with fear. And it was thus that the earthquake was caused. When the sons of Ivalde withdrew their services from the gods, and made compact with their enemies, the terrible Frost-giants, the two giant-maids, Fenja and Menja, seized the handle of the great World-mill and turned it so violently that it went out of order, and disaster was threatened to the Universe. Then southward swarmed the Frost-giants to make war with the gods and their allies.\n\nNow the Vana-god Njord sought to make peace between the gods and the sons of Ivalde, because at that time his son, the sunshine-god, Frey, was with them in northern Alf-heim, where he reigned as a king. He was still but a youth, and the sons of Ivalde had power to do him harm.",

					"With Njord went Bjorno-Hoder, the fair god Balder's brother, the famous archer, who had not yet grown blind. Forsete, Balder's son, was also an envoy, for, like his father, he was a just judge and settler of disputes. Gifted he was with persuasive speech and manners which could subdue the most stubborn disputants. But they discovered that Frey had been given to Beli, \"the howler\", the great giant with enormous body who held him in thrall.\n\nBjorno-Hoder waxed wroth, and he drew his bow to slay Volund-Thjasse and Egil-Orvandel, Ivalde's sons. But Egil-Orvandel was also a great archer, for which he was named Avo. Ere Hoder could shoot, Orvandel's arrow severed his bowstring. Then the god tied the string, and Orvandel's second arrow passed through his fingers without hurting them. Ignoring this dread warning, Balder's brother still persisted, and his third arrow was struck from the bowstring by Orvandel just as he was pulling the string. Thus was Hoder put to shame.\n\nThen the peacemakers turned to take their departure, and Ivalde's sons continued their journey to the north.\n\nThjasse-Volund, son of Ivalde, was filled with boundless vengeance against the gods, and went to his smithy, where he forged the great Sword of Victory. Never was there such a weapon since the beginning of time. It shone like the sun in heaven, and there was no substance that it would not cleave. More terrible was it than Thor's hammer, which the sons of Sindre had made, for he who wielded the sword could prevail over the Thunder-god. Thjasse-Volund was resolved to subdue the gods and conquer Asgard. He also made a ring which multiplied till it became a chain to bind the wind.\n\nBut grave Mimer-Nidhad, who is also called Narve, \"the binder\", came to know of the dread sword which",

					"his rebellious subject had constructed, and he still remained the faithful friend of the gods. He knew well the power possessed by the sword, and feared the disaster which it would cause. So he went to Wolfdales, in Nifel-heim, where Thjasse-Volund had built his, great smithy, and seized the elf-smith, whom he bound with chains. Then The Binder took with him the sword, and also the magic ring from among seven hundred other rings, which it had produced. These he bore unto river-girdled Hela, where he concealed them in his deep cave, heaped with treasure, over which his son was guard. There the sword and the ring were kept until they were recaptured by The Shining One, who prevailed over Thor and became a god in Asgard--Svipdag the Brave, the hero of heroes. But ere that day came many great battles were fought, and mighty warriors perished in their pride.\n\nThe great hero who fought against the giants and Ivalde's sons in the winter war was Halfdan, son of Thor, who by tellers of old tales has also been called Mannus.\n\nAt his birth there were dread omens which foretold his glory and his doom. Eagles screeched, the clamour of thunder was heard, and the shadow of Thor fell over the house. Norns came and twisted the threads of fate. Of gold they made the warp of the web and fastened it under the moon; the ends were hid in the east and the west. One fateful thread was drawn northward towards Jotun-heim, the giants' home, and Urd decreed that it should hold there forever.\n\nHungry ravens cawed one to another, and welcomed the wolf-eyed child who would cause them to thrive with blood and the flesh of slaughtered men. They rejoiced that the battle-feast would soon be spread for them.\n\nHalfdan's mother heard the ravens' song and dreaded",

					"his fate. Two swords there were in her home and they were accursed. She buried them deep in the earth, so that the child, when he grew strong, would not find them. But Halfdan soon displayed his warrior strength. When yet a youth he wrestled with a giant-bear and slew it.\n\nThen came a day when Halfdan found a hidden sword, and in a conflict he slew with it his half-brother, nor did he know it was he. Thus was the sword accursed indeed.\n\nHalfdan had knowledge from his father of sacred runes, and he knew the speech of birds, which gave him advantage over his enemies, for he was warned when danger was at hand.\n\nWhen he grew years of knowledge and strength, he went forth to seek his fortunes. One day he met Signe-Alveig, which means \"nourishing drink\", and her he loved and married. She was the fair swan-maiden whose sister Groa was wed to Egil-Orvandel, son of Ivalde, and their son was Hadding. But although Halfdan lived for long at peace with Ivalde's clan, he fought against them when they leagued themselves with the Frost-giants to combat with the gods and their allies.\n\nA strenuous campaign did Thor's son wage against the Frost-giants on the borders of Midgard, which they sought to possess and put under thrall. The giant Froste was their leader, and with him was Fjalar-Suttung, the fire-giant from Surtur's deep dales. Their march southward Halfdan stayed, and to the bleak north he drave them in confusion. A great battle he fought at Svarin's mound, where he slew Sigbrygg, the sire of his wife and Groa, her sister. Groa he took captive, and he put shame upon her, and with her he took her son Svipdag.\n\nWith Halfdan on his triumphant march northward",

					"went Odin's victorious Valkyries, and nightly the heavens flamed with their splendour, by men called \"The Northern Lights\".\n\nOn the borders of Jotun-heim Halfdan overcame Orvandel-Egil, the great archer, whose house he surrounded in the night.\n\nThen it came about that Halfdan caused Orvandel to make trial of his skill, for hearing he had boasted that he could with the first arrow from his bow hit a small apple placed upon a stick at a great distance, he ordered Svipdag to stand with an apple upon his head.[~<1~>] Then he commanded Orvandel to perform the deed of which he had boasted on penalty of his life, but promised him his freedom if he achieved success.\n\nSvipdag was led forth. To him his sire spoke words of encouragement and good counsel, so that he might bear the trial with courage and unflinchingly, and also lest he should move and thus cause the arrow to miss its mark. Svipdag he made to stand with his back turned so that he might not behold the drawing of the bow.\n\nThree arrows did Orvandel take from his quiver. Then one he aimed at the apple upon his son's head. Careful aim he took and shot it from the bow, and he clove the apple in twain nor harmed his son.\n\nThen did Halfdan ask him why he had taken three arrows from his quiver, and Orvandel-Egil bade him know that it was his purpose, had his son fallen, to slay the man who had compelled the sore trial of skill.\n\nBut the risk was not avenged upon Halfdan until the, day of Svipdag's triumph.\n\nIn sorrow did Groa pass weary days with Halfdan, to whom she bore a son who was named Gudhorm. Then was Groa rejected with deeper shame. When she, with\n\n[~<1~> Saga version of William Tell myth.]",

					"her son, Svipdag, returned to Orvandel, she was heartbroken and had come nigh to life's end. Svipdag she called to her side and told him she must soon die with the sorrow she bore for the death of her sire and the shame that Halfdan had put upon her. Then she told him that he must needs endure great troubles and much strife, and be ofttimes in death-shadowing peril. \"If mine aid you need at any time,\" she said, \"come to my grave chamber and invoke my spirit, and I shall rise to help you.\" Soon after she spake thus Groa died, and Svipdag wept for her.\n\nThen Orvandel took for wife the beauteous Sith. Their son was Ull, and he grew up to be a strong young warrior like his half-brother.\n\nSvipdag was overcome with desire to be avenged upon Halfdan, and sought to wage war against him. But Sith prevailed upon him to promise that he would go towards the mountains of Jotun-heim, and rescue the goddess Freyja and the god Frey from the giant who kept them imprisoned in his strong castle.\n\nBut Svipdag deemed Sith to be moved with cunning intentions, and he feared that if he went forth upon such an enterprise he would never return. He had need of counsel and of help, and in the darkness of night he went to the stone grave-chamber of his mother and called upon her.\n\n\"Awake,\" he cried, \"as thou didst promise me, and come to me, O mother, in my sore straits!\"\n\nThe spirit of Groa rose out of Hela, where she heard her son's voice calling upon her, and from the grave-chamber she spoke. She told him that he must indeed go on a long journey and meet many perils ere yet he would find Freyja, but she bade him remember that his Norn of fate would be his guide.",

					"Then sang she incantations over Svipdag to protect him from danger and to heal his wounds, to give him courage and set him free from prisons. She also sang incantations to protect him against raging rivers he must needs cross, and against ocean's perils and the perils of vast and high mountains over which he must climb.\n\nNine incantations did Groa utter, and the last gave him security to traverse Nifel-hel and enter Mimer's grove.\n\nWhereupon Groa's voice was silent, and her spirit returned to the Underworld.\n\nSatisfied he would be indeed safe from all danger, Svipdag went northward towards the battleground of the giants. It was his desire to first avenge his grandsire's death and his mother's shame ere yet he would search to find Freyja. So he set himself to lead a giant host against the army of Halfdan, and a dread conflict was fought.\n\nSvipdag was in the midst of the battle, and with Halfdan he waged a duel, but he was overcome and taken prisoner. Then made the giants hurried flight towards the north.\n\nDeep was Halfdan's admiration for the prowess of the young hero, and he offered him his friendship if he would become his ally and help him to continue the campaign against the giants with whom Ivalde's sons were in league. But Svipdag scorned his friendship with defiance, and Halfdan in his wrath caused him to be bound to a tree in the midst of a thick forest, so that he might become the prey of wild beasts.\n\nGroa's son, when he was alone, bethought him of the incantations which his mother had uttered, and one he repeated till the chains that bound him flew away and he was set free. Hither and thither he wandered disconsolately,",

					"nor giant nor foeman could he see, nor could he discover which way he should go.\n\nThen came he to the moon-god ere he rose on his path through the heavens, and by him was Svipdag told where he would find the Sword of Victory which Thjasse-Volund had forged.\n\n\"In Mimer's cave,\" the moon-god said, \"it is concealed, and thou must needs overcome the Keeper of Hela's gate to obtain it.\"\n\nTowards the trackless regions that lead by Hvergelmer's mountain did Svipdag then journey, and over the caves in which giants guard their accursed hoards of treasure. Intense and bitter cold prevailed as he traversed over frostbound ways and wreaths of blocking snow. Now he had need to climb great precipices, and ofttimes he found himself on dizzy mountain ridges, while dread chasms yawned below him. Through many places of horror and peril did Svipdag traverse until he reached the borders of Hela. There he beheld a fair land that gleamed before him, full of flowers of rich fragrance.\n\nHe crossed a dark valley, and a hel-hound pursued him, barking loudly. Then came he to the River of Blades, which was spanned by a bridge of gold, and beyond there was a stone door in Hela's wall, guarded by a strong watchman. With him Svipdag fought and was victorious, and he entered the land of spirits where dwells Mimer and the regenerating race unborn.\n\nProtected by the enchantment of Groa, Svipdag went towards the cave in which the treasures of Mimer are concealed, nor did he let his shadow fall upon it lest Mimer's son Mimingus, who kept watch, should take fear and shrink back into the mountain.\n\nMimingus lay asleep, and Svipdag overcame him and",

					"bound him where he lay. He took from the wall the glittering Sword of Victory and the great Arm-ring which Thjasse-Volund had forged, and then hastened to return by the way he had come. So traversing again the mountains of snow and misty blackness, and escaping the dread perils about him, Svipdag returned with his treasures from the Underworld.\n\nThen without delay did the vengeance-seeking son of Groa open a new campaign against Halfdan. In Asgard it was known that he had secured the dreaded sword which Thjasse-Volund had made so that he might overcome the gods. Mighty Thor seized his iron hammer and went forth to help his son.\n\nGreat was the battle which was waged. Svipdag mowed down his enemies before him, and Halfdan was sorely wounded by an arrow shot from the bow of Orvandel-Egil. Then did Thor press into the midst of the fray, fighting fiercely against the giants, who fell before him until he came against Svipdag. But the hammer which Sindre had made was of no avail against, the young hero, for with the Sword of Victory it was struck by The Shining One and severed from the handle.\n\nWhen Thor was repulsed he fled from the field, and Halfdan went with him.\n\nThus did victory come to Svipdag, and thus was the judgment of the gods defied, for they had placed the workmanship of Sindre's kinsman above that of the sons of Ivalde.\n\nHalfdan died of his wounds, and Thor made haste to Asgard, where the gods awaited the coming of Svipdag with the Sword of Victory, which had been forged so that they might be utterly overcome and Asgard laid waste."
