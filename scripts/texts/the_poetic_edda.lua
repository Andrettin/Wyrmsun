				"~<Helgakvitha Hjorvarthssonar~>\n\n~<The Lay of Helgi the Son of Hjorvarth~>\n\n~<Introductory Note~>\n\nThe three Helgi lays, all found in the ~<Codex~> ~<Regius~>, have been the subjects of a vast amount of discussion, in spite of which many of the facts regarding them are still very far from settled. It is, indeed, scarcely possible to make any unqualified statement regarding these three poems for which a flat contradiction cannot be found in the writings of some scholar of distinction. The origin of the Helgi tradition, its connection with that of Sigurth, the authorship, date and home of the poems, the degree to which they have been altered from their original forms, the status of the composer of the copious prose notes: these and many other allied questions have been and probably always will be matters of dispute among students of the ~<Edda's~> history.\n\nWithout attempting to enter into the discussion in detail, certain theories should be noted. Helgi appears originally to have been a Danish popular hero, the son of King Halfdan. Saxo Grammaticus has a good deal to say about him in that capacity, and it has been pointed out that many of the place names in the Helgi lays can be pretty clearly identified with parts of Denmark and neighboring stretches of the Baltic. The Danish Helgi, according to Saxo, was famed as the conqueror of Hunding and Hothbrodd, the latter as the result of a naval expedition at the head of a considerable fleet.\n\nFrom Denmark the story appears to have spread northward into Norway and westward into the Norse settlements among the islands. Not many of its original features remained, and new ones were added here and there, particularly with regard to Helgi's love affair with Sigrun. The victories over Hunding and Hothbrodd, however, were generally retained, and out of material relating to these two fights, and to the Helgi-Sigrun story, were fashioned the two lays of Helgi Hundingsbane.\n\nHow the Helgi legend became involved with that of the Volsungs is an open question. Both stories travelled from the South, and presumably about the same time, so it is not unnatural",
				
				"that some confusion should have arisen. At no time, however, was the connection particularly close so far as the actual episodes of the two stories were concerned. In the two lays of Helgi Hundingsbane the relationship is established only by the statement that Helgi was the son of Sigmund and Borghild; Sigurth is not mentioned, and in the lay of Helgi the son of Hjorvarth there is no connection at all. On the other hand, Helgi does not appear in any of the Eddic poems dealing directly with the Volsung stories, although in one passage of doubtful authenticity (cf. ~<Reginsmol~>, introductory note) his traditional enemy, Hunding, does, represented by his sons. In the ~<Volsungasaga~> the story of Helgi, including the fights with Hunding and Hothbrodd and the love affair with Sigrun, is told in chapters 8 and 9 without otherwise affecting the course of the narrative. Here, as in the Helgi lays, Helgi is the son of Sigmund Volsungsson and Borghild; Sigurth, on the other hand, is the son of Sigmund and Hjordis, the latter being the daughter of King Eylimi. Still another son, who complicates both stories somewhat, is Sinfjotli, son of Sigmund and his own sister, Signy. Sinfjotli appears in both of the Helgi Hundingsbane lays and in the ~<Volsungasaga~>, but not in any of the Eddic poems belonging to the Volsung cycle (cf. ~<Fra~> ~<Dautha~> ~<Sinfjotla~> and note).\n\nThere is a certain amount of resemblance between the story of Helgi and Sigrun and that of Sigurth and Brynhild, particularly as the annotator responsible for the prose notes insists that Sigrun was a Valkyrie. Whether this resemblance was the cause of bringing the two stories together, or whether the identification of Helgi as Sigmund's son resulted in alterations of the love story in the Helgi poems, cannot be determined. The first of the three Helgi poems, the lay of Helgi the son of Hjorvarth, is a somewhat distant cousin of the other two. The Helgi in question is apparently the same traditional figure, and he leads a naval expedition, but he is not the son of Sigmund, there is no connection with the Volsung cycle, and his wife is Svava, not Sigrun. At the same time, the points of general resemblance with the two Helgi Hundingsbane lays are such as to indicate a common origin, provided one goes far enough back. The annotator brings the stories together by the naive expedient of having Helgi \"born again,\" and not once only, but twice.",
				
				"The first Helgi lay, is manifestly in bad shape, and includes at least two distinct poems, differentiated not only by subject matter but by metrical form. Although the question is debatable, the longer of these poems (stanzas 1-11 and 31-43) seems in turn to have been compounded out of fragments of two or more Helgi poems. The first five stanzas are a dialogue between a bird and Atli, one of Hjorvarth's followers, concerning the winning of Sigrlin, who is destined to be Hjorvarth's wife and Helgi's mother. Stanzas 6-11 are a dialogue between Helgi and a Valkyrie (the accompanying prose so calls her, and identifies her as Svava, but there is nothing in the verse to prove this). Stanzas 12-30 form a fairly consecutive unit, in which Atli, on guard over Helgi's ship, has a vigorous argument with a giantess, Hrimgerth, whence this section has sometimes been called the ~<Hrimgertharmol~> (~<Lay~> ~<of~> ~<Hrimgerth~>). The last section, stanzas 31-43, is, again fairly consecutive, and tells of the death of Helgi following the rash oath of his brother, Hethin, to win Svava for himself.\n\nParts I, II, and IV may all have come from the same poem or they may not; it is quite impossible to tell surely. All of them are generally dated by commentators not later than the first half of the tenth century, whereas the ~<Hrimgertharmol~> (section III) is placed considerably later. When and by whom these fragments were pieced together is another vexed question, and this involves a consideration of the prose notes and links, of which the ~<Helgakvitha ~<Hjorvarthssonar~> has a larger amount than any other poem in the ~<Edda~>. These prose links contain practically all the narrative, the verse being almost exclusively dialogue. Whoever composed them seems to have been consciously trying to bring his chaotic verse material into some semblance of unity, but he did his work pretty clumsily, with manifest blunders and contradictions. Bugge has advanced the theory that these prose passages are to be regarded as an original and necessary part of the work, but this hardly squares with the evidence.\n\nIt seems probable, rather, that as the Helgi tradition spread from its native Denmark through the Norse regions of the North and West, and became gradually interwoven, although not in essentials, with the other great hero cycle from the South, that of the Volsungs, a considerable number of poems dealing with Helgi were composed, at different times and in different places,",
				
				"reflecting varied forms of the story. Many generations after wards, when Iceland's literary period had arrived, some zealous scribe committed to writing such poems or fragments of poems as he knew, piecing them together and annotating them on the basis of information which had reached him through other channels. The prose notes to ~<Helgakvitha~> ~<Hundingsbana~> ~<II~> frankly admit this patchwork process: a section of four stanzas (13-16) is introduced with the phrase, \"as is said in the Old Volsung Lay\"; the final prose note cites an incident \"told in the ~<Karuljoth~> (~<Lay~> ~<of~> ~<Kara~>),\" and a two-line speech is quoted \"as it was written before in the ~<Helgakvitha~>.\"\n\nThe whole problem of the origin, character and home of the Helgi poems has been discussed in great detail by Bugge in his ~<Helge-Digtene~> ~<i~> ~<den~> ~<Ældre~> ~<Edda~>, ~<Deres~> ~<Hjem~> ~<og~> ~<Forbindelser~>, which, as translated by W. H. Schofield under the title ~<The~> ~<Home~> ~<of~> ~<the~> ~<Eddic~> ~<Poems~>, is available for readers of English. This study is exceedingly valuable, if not in all respects convincing. The whole matter is so complex and so important in the history of Old Norse literature, and any intelligent reading of the Helgi poems is so dependent on an understanding of the conditions under which they have come down to us, that I have here discussed the question more extensively than the scope of a mere introductory note to a single poem would warrant.\n\n~<(I)~>\n\n~<Of Hjorvarth~> ~<and~> ~<Sigrlin~>\n\nHjorvarth was the name of a king, who had four wives: one was called Alfhild, and their son was named Hethin; the second was called Særeith, and their son was named Humlung; the third was called Sinrjoth, and their son was\n\n[~<Prose~>: In the manuscript the sub-title, \"Of Hjorvarth and Sigrlin,\" stands as the title for the whole poem, though it clearly applies only to the first five stanzas. Most editions employ the title here given. ~<Hjorvarth~>: the name is a not uncommon one;]",
				
				"named Hymling. King Hjorvarth had made a great vow to have as wife whatsoever woman he knew was fairest. He learned that King Svafnir had a daughter fairer than all others, whose name was Sigrlin. Ithmund was the name of one of his jarls; he had a son called Atli, who went to woo Sigrlin on behalf of the king. He dwelt the winter long with King Svafnir. There was a jarl called Franmar, Sigrlin's foster-father; his daughter was named Alof. The jarl told him that the maiden's hand was denied, and Atli went home. Atli, the jarl's son, stood one day in a certain wood; a bird sat in the branches up over him, and it had heard that his men called Hjorvarth's wives the fairest of women. The bird twittered, and Atli hearkened to what it spoke. It said:\n\n[there are two men of that name mentioned in the mythical heroic genealogies of the ~<Hyndluljoth~> (stanzas 23 and 28), and Hjorvarth appears in ~<Helgakvitha~> ~<Hundingsbana~> I (stanza 14) and II (prose after stanza 12) as a son of Hunding. This particular Hjorvarth is called by the annotator, but not directly so in the verse, a king of Norway. The name means \"Sword-Guardian.\" ~<Four~> ~<wives~>: polygamy, while very. infrequent, appears occasionally in the Norse sagas. ~<Alfhild~>: \"Elf-Warrior.\" ~<Hethin~>: \"Fur-Clothed\" (?). ~<Særeith~>: \"Sea-Rider.\" ~<Sinrjoth~>: \"Ever-Red.\" The fourth wife, not here named, may be Sigrlin. It has been suggested that Særeith and Sinrjoth may be northern and southern forms of the same name, as also ~<Humlung~> and ~<Hymling~>, their sons. ~<Svafnir~>: the annotator calls him king of Svavaland, apparently a place on the mainland which could be reached from Norway either by land or by sea. ~<Sigrlin~>: \"The Conquering Serpent.\" ~<Atli~>: Norse form of the Gothic Attila (Etzel). ~<Alof~>: perhaps a feminine form of Olaf. ~<A~> ~<bird~>: compare the counsel given by the birds to Sigurth after the slaying of Fafnir (Fafnismol, stanzas 32-38). This is one of the many curious resemblances between the Helgi and the Sigurth stories.]",
				
				"1. \"Sawest thou Sigrlin, | Svafnir's daughter,\nThe fairest maid | in her home-land found?\nThough Hjorvath's wives | by men are held\nGoodly to see | in Glasir's wood.\"\n\n~<Atli spake:~>\n2. \"Now with Atli, | Ithmund's son,\nWilt thou say more, | thou bird so wise?\"\n\n~<The bird spake:~>\n\"I may if the prince | an offering makes,\nAnd I have what I will | from the house of the king.\"\n\n~<Atli spake:~>\n3. \"Choose not Hjorvarth, | nor sons of his,\nNor the wives so fair | of the famous chief;\nAsk not the brides | that the prince's are;\nFair let us deal | in friendly wise.\"\n\n~<The bird spake:~>\n4. \"A fane will I ask, | and altars many,\nGold-horned cattle | the prince shall give me,\nIf Sigrlin yet | shall sleep in his arms,\nOr free of will | the hero shall follow.\"\n\n[1. ~<Glasir's~> ~<wood~>: Snorri in the ~<Skaldskaparmal~> quotes a half stanza to the effect that \"Glasir stands with golden leaves before Othin's hall,\" and calls it \"the fairest wood among gods and men.\" The phrase as used here seems to mean little.\n\n4. The bird's demands would indicate that it is in reality one of the gods. ~<Gold-horned~> ~<cattle~>: cf. ~<Thrymskvitha~>, 23. There]",

				"This was before Atli went on his journey; but when he came home, and the king asked his tidings, he said:\n\n5. \"Trouble we had, | but tidings none,\nOur horses failed | in the mountains high,\nThe waters of Sæmorn | we needs must wade;\nSvafnir's daughter, | with rings bedecked,\nShe whom we sought, | was still denied us.\"\n\nThe king bade that they should go another time, and he went with them himself, But when they came up on the mountain, they saw Svavaland burning and mighty dust-clouds from many steeds. The king rode from the mountain forward into the land, and made a night's stay hard by a stream. Atli kept watch and went over the stream; he found there a house. A great bird sat on the housetop to guard it, but he was asleep. Atli hurled his spear at the bird and slew it, and in the house he found Sigrlin the king's daughter and Alof the jarl's daughter, and he brought them both thence with him. Jarl Franmar had changed himself into the likeness of an eagle, and guarded them from the enemy host by magic. Hrothmar was the name of a king, a wooer of Sigrlin; he slew the\n\n[are other references to gilding the horns of cattle, particularly for sacrificial purposes.\n\n~<Prose~>. The annotator contradicts himself here, as he had already stated that Atli was on his way home.\n\n5.

				"king of Svavaland and had plundered and burned his land. King Hjorvarth took Sigrlin, and Atli took Alof.\n\n~<(II)~>\n\nHjorvarth and Sigrlin had a son, mighty and of noble stature; he was a silent man, and no name stuck fast to him. He sat on a hill, and saw nine Valkyries riding; one of them was the fairest of all. She spake:\n\n6. \"Late wilt thou, Helgi, | have hoard of rings,\nThou battle-tree fierce, | or of shining fields,--\nThe eagle screams soon,-- | if never thou speakest,\nThough, hero, hard | thy heart may cry.\"\n\n~<Helgi spake:~>\n7. \"What gift shall I have | with Helgi's name,\nGlorious maid, | for the giving is thine?\n\n[suitor, Hrothmar. The beginning of a new section (II) is indicated in the manuscript only by the unusually large capital letter with which \"Hjorvarth\" begins. ~<No~> ~<name~>, etc.: this probably means that Helgi had always been so silent that he would answer to no name, with the result that he had none. ~<Valkyries~>: cf. ~<Voluspo~>, 31 and note. The annotator insists here and in the prose after stanza 9 that Svava was a Valkyrie, but there is nothing in the verse to prove it, or, indeed, to identify the Svava of the last section of the poem with the person who gave Helgi his name. In the ~<Volsungasaga~> Sigmund himself names his son Helgi, and gives him a sword, following Helgakvitha ~<Hundingsbana~> I.\n\n6. ~<Battle-free~>: poetic phrase for \"warrior.\" ~<Shining~> ~<fields~>: the words in the manuscript may form a proper name, Rothulsvoll, having this meaning.\n\n7. ~<Gift~>: not only was it customary to give gifts with the naming]",

She gave Helgi this name, and shielded him oft thereafter in battle.

Then Helgi got the sword that Svava had told him of. So he went, and Atli with him, and they slew Hrothmar, and they did many great deeds.\n\n~<(III)~>\n\nHe slew the giant Hati, whom he found sitting on a certain mountain. Helgi and Atli lay with their ships in Hatafjord. Atli kept watch during the first part of the night. Hrimgerth, Hati's daughter, spake:\n\n12. \"Who are the heroes | in Hatafjord?\nThe ships are covered with shields;\n\n[victory over King Hrothmar, who had killed his mother's father (cf. prose after stanza 5). It has been suggested, in consequence, that stanzas 10-11 may be a separate fragment. The verse tells nothing of the battle, merely giving Helgi's reproaches to his father for having left Svafnir's death and the burning of Svavaland unavenged.\n\n~<Prose~>. The manuscript does not indicate any break, but the episode which forms the basis of the ~<Hrimgertharmol~> (stanzas 12-30) clearly begins with the slaying of the giant Hati (\"The Hateful\" ). ~<Hatafjord~>: \"Hati's Fjord.\" ~<Hrimgerth~>: \"Frost Shrouded\"]",

The manuscript does not indicate the speaker. The pun on \"Atli\" and \"atall\" (meaning \"ill\") is untranslatable.]",
				
				"Nine miles deeper | down mayst thou sink,\nAnd a tree grow tall on thy bosom.\"\n\n~<Hrimgerth spake:~>\n17. \"Hrimgerth am I, | my father was Hati,\nOf giants the most in might;\nMany a woman | he won from her home,\nEre Helgi hewed him down.\"\n\n~<Atli spake:~>\n18. \"Witch, in front | of the ship thou wast,\nAnd lay before the fjord;\nTo Ron wouldst have given | the ruler's men,\nIf a spear had not stuck in thy flesh.\"\n\n~<Hrimgerth spake:~>\n19. \"Dull art thou, Atli, | thou dreamest, methinks,\nThe lids lie over thine eyes;\nBy the leader's ships | my mother lay,\nHlothvarth's sons on the sea I slew.\n\n[17.

From this point to the end the manuscript does not indicate the speakers. ~<Ron~>: wife of the sea-god Ægir, who draws drowning men into the sea with her net. There is no other reference to the wounding of Hrimgerth.\n\n19. Apparently both Hrimgerth and her mother, Hati's wife, had sought to destroy Helgi's ships, and had actually killed some of his companions, the sons of ~<Hlothvarth~>, concerning whom nothing more is known. Many editors assume that a stanza containing a speech by Atli has been lost after stanza 19.]",

Of the giant ~<Lothin~> (\"The Shaggy\") and his home in ~<Tholley~> (\"Pine Island\") nothing is known. Cf. ~<Skirnismol~>, 35.\n\n26. Something is clearly wrong with this stanza, and the manuscript indicates line 6 as the beginning of a new one. Perhaps a line (between lines 4 and 5) has been lost, or perhaps the lines in parenthesis are interpolations. Hrimgerth here refers to Svava, or to the protectress with whom the annotator has identified her, as having saved Helgi and his, ships from the vengeance of the giantesses. In the original line 1 includes Helgi's name, which makes it metrically incorrect.]",

Again something is clearly wrong, and the last three lines look like interpolations, though some editors have tried to reconstruct two full stanzas. The passage suggests the identification of the Valkyries with the clouds.\n\n29. Some editions give this speech to Helgi. ~<Eastward~>: Atli and Helgi have held Hrimgerth in talk till sunrise, and the sun's rays turn her into stone.

The manuscript does not indicate a new section of the poem. ~<Eylimi~>: cf. note on prose after stanza 9. ~<Valkyrie~>: here, as before, the annotator has apparently nothing but his own imagination on which to base his statement. Svava in the ensuing stanzas certainly does not behave like a Valkyrie. ~<Norway~>: the annotator doubtless based this statement on the reference to Norway in line 2 of stanza 31. ~<Yule-eve~>: the Yule feast, marking the new year, was a great event in the heathen North. It was a time of feasting and merrymaking, vows (\"New Year's resolutions\"), ghosts and witches; the spirits had their greatest power on Yule-eve. ~<The~> ~<king's~> ~<toast~>: vows made at the passing of the king's cup at the Yule feast were particularly sacred. ~<Sacred~> ~<boar~>: a boar consecrated to Freyr, an integral part of the Yule rites.

She said, \"Thou shalt pay for this at the king's toast.\" That evening the great vows were taken; the sacred boar was brought in, the men laid their hands thereon, and took their vows at the king's toast. Hethin vowed that he would have Svava, Eylimi's daughter, the beloved of his brother Helgi; then such great grief seized him that he went forth on wild paths southward over the land, and found Helgi, his brother.

The point seems to be simply that there were so many Helgi stories current, and the hero died in so many irreconcilable ways, that tradition had to have him born over again, not once only but several times, to accommodate his many deaths, and to avoid splitting him up into several Helgis.

				"~<Helgakvitha Hundingsbana I~>\n\n~<The First Lay of Helgi Hundingsbane~>\n\n~<Introductory Note~>\n\nThe general subject of the Helgi lays is considered in the introduction to ~<Helgakvitha~> ~<Hjorvarthssonar~>, and it is needless here to repeat the statements there made. The first lay of Helgi Hundingsbane is unquestionably one of the latest of the Eddic poems, and was composed probably not earlier than the second quarter of the eleventh century. It presents several unusual characteristics. For one thing, it is among the few essentially narrative poems in the whole collection, telling a consecutive story in verse, and, except for the abusive dialogue between Sinfjotli and Gothmund, which clearly was based on another and older poem, it does so with relatively little use of dialogue. It is, in fact, a ballad, and in the main an exceedingly vigorous one. The annotator, who added his prose narrative notes so freely in the other Helgi poems, here found nothing to do. The available evidence indicates that narrative verse was a relatively late development in Old Norse poetry, and it is significant that most of the poems which consist chiefly, not of dialogue, but of narrative stanzas, such as the first Helgi Hundingsbane lay and the two Atli lays, can safely be dated, on the basis of other evidence, after the year 1000.\n\nThe first Helgi Hundingsbane lay is again differentiated from most of the Eddic poems by the character of its language. It is full of those verbal intricacies which were the delight of the Norse skalds, and which made Snorri's dictionary of poetic phrases an absolute necessity. Many of these I have paraphrased in the translation; some I have simplified or wholly avoided. A single line will serve to indicate the character of this form of complex diction (stanza 56, line 4): \"And the horse of the giantess raven's-food had.\" This means simply that wolves (giantesses habitually rode on wolves) ate the bodies of the dead.\n\nExcept for its intricacies of diction, and the possible loss of a stanza here and there, the poem is comparatively simple. The story belongs in all its essentials to the Helgi tradition, with the Volsung cycle brought in only to the extent of making Helgi the son of Sigmund, and in the introduction of Sinfjotli, son of Sigmund and his sister Signy, in a passage which has",
				
				"little or nothing to do with the course of the narrative, and which looks like an expansion of a passage from some older poem, perhaps from the \"old Volsung lay\" to which the annotator of the second Helgi Hundingsbane lay refers (prose after stanza 12). There are many proper names, some of which betray the confusion caused by the blending of the two sets of traditions; for example, Helgi appears indiscriminately as an Ylfing (which presumably he was before the Volsung story became involved) and as a Volsung. Granmar and his sons are called Hniflungs (Nibelungen) in stanza 50, though they seem to have had no connection with this race. The place names have aroused much debate as to the localization of the action, but while some of them probably reflect actual places, there is so much geographical confusion, and such a profusion of names which are almost certainly mythical, that it is hard to believe that the poet had any definite locations in mind.\n\n1. In olden days, | when eagles screamed,\nAnd holy streams | from heaven's crags fell,\nWas Helgi then, | the hero-hearted,\nBorghild's son, | in Bralund born.\n\n2. 'Twas night in the dwelling, | and Norns there came,\nWho shaped the life | of the lofty one;\nThey bade him most famed | of fighters all\nAnd best of princes | ever to be.\n\n[1. The manuscript contains the superscription: \"Here begins the lay of Helgi Hundingbane and h. (Hothbrodd?) The lay of the Volsungs.\" ~<Eagles~>, etc.: the screaming of eagles and water pouring from heaven were portents of the birth of a hero. ~<Borghild~>: Sigmund's first wife; ~<Bralund~> was her home, not Sigmund's.\n\n2. ~<Norns~>: cf. ~<Voluspo~>, 20 and note. Here it is the Norns who]",
				
				"3. Mightily wove they | the web of fate,\nWhile Bralund's towns | were trembling all;\nAnd there the golden | threads they wove,\nAnd in the moon's hall | fast they made them.\n\n4. East and west | the ends they hid,\nIn the middle the hero | should have his land;\nAnd Neri's kinswoman | northward cast\nA chain, and bade it | firm ever to be.\n\n5. Once sorrow had | the Ylfings' son,\nAnd grief the bride | who the loved one had borne.\n\n~<* * * * * *~>\n\nQuoth raven to raven, | on treetop resting,\nSeeking for food, | \"There is something I know.\n\n[preside over Helgi's early destiny, and not a Valkyrie, as in ~<Helgakvitha~> ~<Hjorvarthssonar~>.\n\n3. Line 2 is largely guesswork, the manuscript being obscure. ~<Moon's~> ~<hall~>: the sky.\n\n4. ~<East~>, etc.: the Norris give Helgi fame in the East, West, and North; in the North his renown is particularly to endure. This suggests that the poet was aware of the spread of the Helgi story over many lands. ~<Neri's~> ~<kinswoman~>: evidently one of the Norns, but nothing further is known of Neri, and the word may not be a proper name at all.\n\n5. The manuscript indicates no gap, but it looks as though something had been lost after line 2. ~<Ylfings'~> ~<son~>: Sigmund is evidently meant, though calling him an Ylfing (cf. ~<Hyndluljoth~>, 11 and note) is a manifest error. Helgi, in the tradition as it came from Denmark, was undoubtedly an Ylfing, and the poet, in order to combine the two legends, has to treat the Ylfings and Volsungs as if they were the same family.]",
				
				"6. \"In mail-coat stands | the son of Sigmund,\nA half-day old; | now day is here;\nHis eyes flash sharp | as the heroes' are,\nHe is friend of the wolves; | full glad are we.\"\n\n7. The warrior throng | a ruler thought him,\nGood times, they said, | mankind should see;\nThe king himself | from battle-press came,\nTo give the prince | a leek full proud.\n\n8. Helgi he named him, | and Hringstathir gave him,\nSolfjoll, Snæfjoll, | and Sigarsvoll,\nHringstoth, Hotun, | and Himinvangar,\nAnd a blood-snake bedecked | to Sinfjotli's brother.\n\n[6. ~<Sigmund~>: the chief link between the Helgi and Sigurth stories. He was the son of Volsung, great-grandson of Othin. His children by his first wife, Borghild, were Helgi and Hamund (belonging to the Helgi cycle); his son by his second wife, Hjordis, was Sigurth. An incestuous connection with his sister, Signy (cf. Wagner's Siegmund and Sieglinde) resulted in the birth of Sinfjotli (cf. ~<Fra~> ~<Dautha~> ~<Sinfjotla~> and note).\n\n7. ~<The~> ~<king~>: Sigmund, who gives his son a symbol of the lands which he bestows on him. Regarding the leek, cf. ~<Voluspo~>, 4; ~<Guthrunarkvitha~> I, 17, and ~<Sigrdrifumol~>, 7.\n\n8. ~<Hringstathir~> (\"Ring-Stead\"): quite possibly the historical Ringsted, long a possession of the Danish kings, and thus a relic of the old Helgi tradition. ~<Hringstoth~> may be another form of the same name. ~<Solfjoll~> (\"Sun-Mountain\") and ~<Snæfjoll~> (\"Snow-Mountain\") are fictitious names. Regarding ~<Sigarsvoll~> cf. ~<Helgakvitha~> ~<Hjorvarthssonar~>, stanzas 8 and 35. Saxo mentions a Danish king named Sigar, and the frequency with which the name appears in the Helgi poems may be taken as a reminiscence of Denmark. ~<Hotun~> (\"High Place\"): possibly the village of Tune in Seeland. ~<Himinvangar~> (\"Heaven's Field\"): an imaginary place. Blood-snake: a sword. ~<Sinfjotli~>: cf. note on stanza 6.]",

Saxo mentions a Hunding who was a Saxon king ruling in Jutland, probably the origin of Helgi's traditional foe.\n\n12. ~<Storm~>, etc.: war.\n\n13. ~<Logafjoll~> (\"Flame-Mountain\"): a mythical name. ~<Frothi~>:]",
				
				"Frothi's peace | midst foes they broke,\nThrough the isle went hungrily | Vithrir's hounds.\n\n14.

In this poem Helgi kills all the sons of Hunding, but in the poems of the Sigurth cycle, and the prose notes attached thereto, Sigmund and his father-in-law, Eylimi, are killed by Hunding's sons, on whom Sigurth subsequently takes vengeance (cf. ~<Fra~> ~<Dautha~> ~<Sinfjotla~> and ~<Reginsmol~>).\n\n15. No gap indicated in the manuscript, but almost certainly something has been lost mentioning more specifically the coming of the Valkyries. The lightning which accompanies them suggests again their identification with the clouds (cf. ~<Helgakvitha~> ~<Hjorvarthssonar~>, 28).\n\n16. Some editions fill out the first line: \"He saw there mighty maidens riding.\" The manuscript indicates line 4 as the beginning of a new stanza.]",

Here again there is a confusion of traditions; the Valkyries of the ~<Voluspo~> were as essentially Norse as any part of the older mythology. I doubt if a poet much earlier than the author of the first Helgi Hundingsbane lay would have made his Sigrun, daughter of Hogni, a Valkyrie. It is to be noted that the same complication appears in the Sigurth story, where the undoubted Valkyrie, Brynhild-Sigrdrifa (the latter name is really only an epithet) is hopelessly mixed up with the quite human Brynhild, daughter of Buthli.\n\n18. ~<Breaker~> ~<of~> ~<rings~>: generous prince, because the breaking of rings was the customary form of distributing gold.\n\n19. ~<Granmar~>: the annotator gives an account of him and his family in the prose following stanza 12 of ~<Helgakvitha~> ~<Hundingsbana~> ~<II~>.\n\n20. No gap indicated in the manuscript; some editors combine the stanza with the fragmentary stanza 21, and others fill in with \"And home will carry | Hogni's daughter.\"]",

The manuscript has only lines 1 and 4 with the word \"first\" of line 2, and does not indicate Helgi as the speaker. The ~<Volsungasaga~>, which follows this poem pretty closely, expands Helgi's speech, and lines 2-3 are conjectural versifications of the saga's prose. ~<Isung~>: nothing is known of him beyond the fact, here indicated, that Hothbrodd killed him.\n\n22. ~<Water's~> ~<gleam~>: gold.\n\n23. ~<Brandey~> (\"Brand-Isle\"): not mentioned elsewhere. ~<Hethinsey~> (\"Hethin's Isle\"): possibly the island of Hiddensee, east of Rügen.]",

Such bits of geography as this followed Helgi persistently.\n\n26. No gap indicated in the manuscript. ~<Hotun~>: cf. stanza 8 and note.\n\n27. Line 3 seems to have been interpolated from line 4 of ~<Helgakvitha~> ~<Hundingsbana~> II, 42. ~<Ship's-tents~>: the awnings spread over the deck to shelter the crews from sun and rain when the ships were at anchor. ~<Varinsfjord~>: cf. ~<Helgakvitha~> ~<Hjorvarthssonar~>, 22 and note.]",

It has been suggested that this whole passage (stanzas 33-48) is an interpolation, perhaps from \"the Old Volsung lay.\" This may be, but it seems more probable that the poet used an older poem simply as the basis for this passage, borrowing a little but making up a great deal more.

				"~<Helgakvitha Hundingsbana II~>\n\n~<The Second Lay of Helgi Hundingsbane~>\n\n~<Introductory Note~>\n\nAs the general nature of the Helgi tradition has been considered in the introductory note to ~<Helgakvitha~> ~<Hjorvarthssonar~>, it is necessary here to discuss only the characteristics of this particular poem. The second Helgi Hundingsbane lay is in most respects the exact opposite of the first one: it is in no sense consecutive; it is not a narrative poem, and all or most of it gives evidence of relatively early composition, its origin probably going well back into the tenth century.\n\nIt is frankly nothing but a piece of, in the main, very clumsy patchwork, made up of eight distinct fragments, pieced together awkwardly by the annotator with copious prose notes. One of these fragments (stanzas 13-16) is specifically identified as coming from \"the old Volsung lay.\" What was that poem, and how much more of the extant Helgi-lay compilation was taken from it, and did the annotator know more of it than he included in his patchwork? Conclusive answers to these questions have baffled scholarship, and probably always will do so. My own guess is that the annotator knew little or nothing more than he wrote down; having got the first Helgi Hundingsbane lay, which was obviously in fairly good shape, out of the way, he proceeded to assemble all the odds and ends of verse about Helgi which he could get hold of, putting them together on the basis of the narrative told in the first Helgi lay and of such stories as his knowledge of prose sagas may have yielded.\n\nSection I (stanzas 1-4) deals with an early adventure of Helgi's, -in which he narrowly escapes capture when he ventures into Hunding's home in disguise. Section II (stanzas 5-12) is a dialogue between Helgi and Sigrun at their first meeting. Section III (stanzas 13-16, the \"old Volsung lay\" group) is another dialogue between Helgi and Sigrun when she invokes his aid to save her from Hothbrodd. Section IV (stanzas 17-20, which may well be from the same poem as Section III, is made up of speeches by Helgi and Sigrun after the battle in which Hothbrodd is killed; stanza 21, however, is certainly an interpolation from another poem, as it is in a different meter. Section V (stanzas 22-27) is the dispute between Sinfjotli and Gothmund, evidently",
				
				"in an older form than the one included in the first Helgi Hundingsbane lay. Section VI (stanzas 28-37) gives Dag's speech to his sister, Sigrun, telling of Helgi's death, her curse on her brother and her lament for her slain husband. Section VII (stanza 38) is the remnant of a dispute between Helgi and Hunding, here inserted absurdly out of place. Section VIII (stanzas 39-50) deals with the return of the dead Helgi and Sigrun's visit to him in the burial hill.\n\nSijmons maintains that sections I and II are fragments of the Kara lay mentioned by the annotator in his concluding prose note, and that sections IV, VI, and VIII are from a lost Helgi-Sigrun poem, while Section III comes, of course, from the \"old Volsung lay.\" This seems as good a guess as any other, conclusive proof being quite out of the question.\n\nWere it not for sections, VI and VIII the poem would be little more than a battle-ground for scholars, but those two sections are in many ways as fine as anything in Old Norse poetry. Sigrun's curse of her brother for the slaying of Helgi and her lament for her dead husband, and the extraordinary vividness of the final scene in the burial hill, have a quality which fully offsets the baffling confusion of the rest of the poem.\n\n__________________\n\nKing Sigmund, the son of Volsung, had as wife Borghild, from Bralund. They named their son Helgi, after Helgi Hjorvarthsson; Hagal was Helgi's foster-father. Hunding was the name of a powerful king, and Hundland is named from him. He was a mighty warrior, and had many sons with him on his campaigns. There was enmity and strife between these two, King Hunding and\n\n[~<Prose~>.

				"King Sigmund, and each slew the other's kinsmen. King Sigmund and his family were called Volsungs and Ylfings. Helgi went as a spy to the home of King Hunding in disguise. Hæming, a son of King Hunding's, was at home. When Helgi went forth, then he met a young herdsman, and said:\n\n1. \"Say to Hæming | that Helgi knows\nWhom the heroes | in armor hid;\nA gray wolf had they | within their hall,\nWhom King Hunding | Hamal thought.\"\n\nHamal was the name of Hagal's son. King Hunding\n\n[was named after Helgi Hjorvarthsson is a naive way of getting around the difficulties created by the two sets of Helgi stories. He might equally well have said that the new Helgi was the old one born again, as he accounts for Sigrun in this way (\"she was Svava reborn\"). ~<Hagal~>: not elsewhere mentioned; it was a common custom to have boys brought up by foster-parents. ~<Hunding~> and ~<Hundland~>: cf. ~<Helgakvitha~> ~<Hundingsbana~> ~<I~>, 10 and note. ~<Volsungs~> and ~<Ylfings~>: regarding this confusion of family names cf. ~<Helgakvitha~> ~<Hundingsbana~> ~<I~>, 5 and note. ~<Hæming~>: his name does not appear in the list of Hunding's sons. It is quite possible that these opening stanzas (1-4) do not refer to Hunding at all.\n\n1. Helgi appears to have stayed with Hunding under the name of Hamal, but now, thinking himself safe, he sends word of who he really is. ~<Hunding~>: it has been suggested that the compiler may have inserted this name to fit what he thought the story ought to be, in place of Hæming, or even Hadding. If stanzas 1-4 are a fragment of the ~<Karuljoth~> (~<Lay~> ~<of~> ~<Kara~>), this latter suggestion is quite reasonable, for in that poem, which we do not possess, but which supplied material for the compilers of the ~<Hromundar~> ~<saga~> ~<Greipssonar~>, Helgi appears as Helgi Haddingjaskati (cf. final prose note).

He had many sons; one was named Hothbrodd, another Gothmund, a third Starkath. Hothbrodd was in a kings' meeting, and he won the promise of having Sigrun, Hogni's daughter, for his wife. But when she heard this, she rode with the Valkyries over air and sea to seek Helgi. Helgi was then at Logafjoll, and had fought with Hunding's sons; there he killed Alf and Eyolf, Hjorvarth and Hervarth. He was all weary with battle, and sat under the eagle-stone. There Sigrun found him, and ran to throw her arms about his neck, and kissed him, and told him her tidings, as is set forth in the old Volsung lay:\n\n13.

Granmar's sons sat on a certain mountain as the ships sailed toward the land. Gothmund leaped on a horse and rode for news to a promontory near the harbor; the Volsungs were even then lowering their sails.

She said:\n\n17. \"Never shall Sigrun | from Sevafjoll,\nHothbrodd king, | be held in thine arms;\nGranmar's sons | full cold have grown,\nAnd the giant-steeds gray | on corpses gorge.\"\n\nThen she sought out Helgi, and was full of joy He said:\n\n18. \"Maid, not fair | is all thy fortune,\nThe Norris I blame | that this should be;\nThis morn there fell | at Frekastein\nBragi and Hogni | beneath my hand.\n\n19. \"At Hlebjorg fell | the sons of Hrollaug,\nStarkath the king | at Styrkleifar;\n\n[17. ~<Sevafjoll~> (\"Wet Mountain\"): mentioned only in this poem. ~<Giant-steeds~>: wolves, the usual steeds of giantesses; cf. ~<Helgakvitha~> ~<Hundingsbana~> ~<I~>, 56.\n\n18. ~<Maid~>: the word thus rendered is the same doubtful one which appears in ~<Völundarkvitha~>, 1 and 5, and which may mean specifically a Valkyrie (Gering translates it \"helmed\" or \"heroic\") or simply \"wise.\" Cf. ~<Völundarkvitha~>, note on introductory prose. ~<Norns~>: cf. ~<Voluspo~>, 20 and note.

Of ~<Hrollaug's~> ~<sons~> nothing further is known. ~<Starkath~>: this name gives a hint of the origin of this stanza, for Saxo Grammaticus tells of the slaying of the Swedish hero Starkath (\"The Strong\") the son of Storverk, and describes how his severed head bit the ground in anger (cf. line 4). In all probability this stanza is from an entirely different poem, dealing with the Starkath story, and the annotator's attempt to identify the Swedish hero as a third son of Granmar is quite without foundation.\n\n21. The difference of meter would of itself be enough to indicate that this stanza comes from an entirely different poem. A few editions assign the whole stanza to Helgi, but lines 3-4. are almost certainly Sigrun's, and the manuscript begins line 3 with a large capital letter following a period.]",

With this stanza begins the dispute between Gothmund and Sinfjotli which, together with Helgi's rebuke to his half brother, appears at much greater length in ~<Helgakvitha~> ~<Hundingsbana~> I, 33-48. It is introduced here manifestly in the wrong place. The version here given is almost certainly the older of the two, but the resemblance is so striking, and in some cases (notably in Helgi's rebuke) the stanzas are so nearly identical, that it seems probable that the composer of the first Helgi Hundingsbane lay borrowed directly from the poem of which the present dialogue is a fragment. Flag: the banner (\"gunnfani,\" cf. \"gonfalon\") here serves as the signal for war instead of the red shield mentioned in ~<Helgakvitha~> ~<Hundingsbana~> I, 34. ~<Battle-light~>: perhaps the \"northern lights.\"\n\n23. Lines 3-4 are obscure, and in the manuscript show signs of error. Helgi had not at this time, so far as we know, conquered any of Hothbrodd's land. ~<The~> ~<realm~> ~<of~> ~<the~> ~<fishes~>, in line 4, presumably means the sea, but the word here translated \"fishes\" is obscure, and many editors treat it as a proper name, \"the realm of the Fjorsungs,\" but without further suggestion as to who or what the Fjorsungs are.]",

The word here translated ~<swords~> is a conjectural emendation; the manuscript implies merely an invitation to continue the quarrel at Frekastein. ~<Hothbrodd~>: apparently he is here considered as present during the dispute; some editors, in defiance of the meter, have emended the line to mean \"Time is it for Hothbrodd | vengeance to have.\"\n\n26-27. Cf. ~<Helgakvitha~> ~<Hundingsbana~> I, 47-48, which are nearly identical.

				"~<(VI)~>\n\nHelgi took Sigrun to wife, and they had sons. Helgi did not reach old age. Dag, the son of Hogni, offered sacrifice to Othin to be avenged for his father's death; Othin gave Dag his spear. Dag found Helgi, his brother-in-law, at a place which is called Fjoturlund. He thrust the spear through Helgi's body. Then Helgi fell, and Dag rode to Sevafjoll and told Sigrun the tidings:\n\n28. \"Sad am I, sister, | sorrow to tell thee,\nWoe to my kin | unwilling I worked;\nIn the morn there fell | at Fjoturlund\nThe noblest prince | the world has known,\n(And his heel he set | on the heroes' necks.)\"\n\n~<Sigrun spake:~>\n29. \"Now may every | oath thee bite\nThat with Helgi | sworn thou hast,\nBy the water | bright of Leipt,\nAnd the ice-cold | stone of Uth.\n\n[~<Prose~>.

This stanza apparently comes from an otherwise lost passage containing a contest of words between Helgi and Hunding; indeed the name of Hunding may have been substituted for another one beginning with \"H,\" and the stanza originally have had no connection with Helgi at all.

In the saga Helgi Haddingjaskati (Helgi the Haddings' Hero) is protected by the Valkyrie Kara, who flies over him in the form of a swan (note once more the Valkyrie swan-maiden confusion); but in his fight with Hromund he swings his sword so high that he accidentally gives Kara a mortal wound, where upon Hromund cuts off his head. As this makes the third recorded death of Helgi (once at the hands of Alf, once at those of Dag, and finally in the fight with Hromund), the phenomenon of his rebirth is not surprising. The points of resemblance in all the Helgi stories, including the one told in the lost ~<Karuljoth~>, are sufficiently striking so that it is impossible not to see in them a common origin, and not to believe that Helgi the son of Hjorvarth, Helgi the son of Sigmund and Helgi the Haddings'-Hero (not to mention various other Helgis who probably figured in songs and stories now lost) were all originally the same Helgi who appears in the early traditions of Denmark.]"

				"~<Brot Af Sigurtharkvithu~>\n\n~<Fragment of a Sigurth Lay~>\n\n~<Introductory Note~>\n\nThe gap of eight leaves in the ~<Codex Regius~> (cf. introductory note to the ~<Sigrdrifumol~>) is followed by a passage of twenty stanzas which is evidently the end of a longer poem, the greater part of it having been contained in the lost section of the manuscript. There is here little question of such a compilation as made up the so-called ~<Reginsmol~>, ~<Fafnismol~>, and ~<Sigrdrifumol~>; the extant fragment shows every sign of being part of a poem which, as it stood in the manuscript, was a complete and definite unit. The end is clearly marked; the following poem, ~<Guthrunarkvitha~> I, carries a specific heading in the manuscript, so that there is no uncertainty as to where the fragment closes.\n\nIt seems altogether likely that the twenty stanzas thus remaining are the end of a poem entitled ~<Sigurtharkvitha~> (Lay of Sigurth), and, more specifically, the \"Long\" Lay of Sigurth. The extant and complete Sigurth lay, a relatively late work, is referred to by the annotator as the \"Short\" Lay of Sigurth, which, of course, presupposes the existence of a longer poem with the same title. As the \"short\" lay is one of the longest poems in the whole collection (seventy stanzas), it follows that the other one must have been considerably more extensive in order to have been thus distinguished by its length. It may be guessed, then, that not less than eighty or a hundred stanzas, and possibly more, of the \"Long\" Lay of Sigurth have been lost with the missing pages of ~<Regius~>.\n\nThe narrative, from the point at which the so-called ~<Sigrdrifumol~> breaks off to that at which the ~<Brot~> takes it up, is given with considerable detail in the Volsungasaga. In this prose narrative four stanzas are quoted, and one of them is specifically introduced with the phrase: \"as is told in the Lay of Sigurth.\" It is possible, but most unlikely, that the entire passage paraphrases this poem alone; such an assumption would give the Lay of Sigurth not less than two hundred and fifty stanzas (allowing about fifteen stanzas to each of the missing pages), and moreover there are inconsistencies in the ~<Volsungasaga~> narrative suggesting that different and more or less conflicting poems were used as sources. The chances are that the \"Long\" Lay of Sigurth",

				"filled approximately the latter half of the lost section of the manuscript, the first half including poems of which the only trace is to be found in the ~<Volsungasaga~> prose paraphrase and in two of the stanzas therein quoted.\n\nThe course of the ~<Volsungasaga's~> story from the ~<Sigrdrifumol~> to the ~<Brot~> is, briefly, as follows. After leaving the Valkyrie, Sigurth comes to the dwelling of Heimir, Brynhild's brother-in-law, where he meets Brynhild and they swear oaths of fidelity anew (the ~<Volsungasaga~> is no more lucid with regard to the Brynhild-Sigrdrifa confusion than was the annotator of the poems). Then the scene shifts to the home of the Gjukungs. Guthrun, Gjuki's daughter, has a terrifying dream, and visits Brynhild to have it explained, which the latter does by foretelling pretty much everything that is going to happen; this episode was presumably the subject of a separate poem in the lost section of the manuscript. Guthrun returns home, and Sigurth soon arrives, to be made enthusiastically welcome. Grimhild, mother of Gunnar and Guthrun, gives him a magic draught which makes him forget all about Brynhild, and shortly thereafter he marries Guthrun.\n\nThen follows the episode of the winning of Brynhild for Gunnar (cf. ~<Gripisspo~>, 97 and note). This was certainly the subject of a poem, possibly of the first part of the \"Long\" Lay of Sigurth, although it seems more likely that the episode was dealt with in a separate poem. The ~<Volsungasaga~> quotes two stanzas describing Sigurth's triumphant passing through the flames after Gunnar has failed and the two have changed forms. They run thus:\n\nThe fire raged, | the earth was rocked,\nThe flames leaped high | to heaven itself;\nFew were the hardy | heroes would dare\nTo ride or leap | the raging flames.\n\nSigurth urged Grani | then with his sword,\nThe fire slackened | before the hero,\nThe flames sank low | for the greedy of fame,\nThe armor flashed | that Regin had fashioned.\n\nAfter Sigurth has spent three nights with Brynhild, laying his sword between them (cf. ~<Gripisspo~>, 41 and note), he and Gunnar return home, while Brynhild goes to the dwelling of her brother-in-law, Heimir, and makes ready for her marriage with Gunnar,",

				"directing Heimir to care for her daughter by Sigurth, Aslaug. The wedding takes place, to be followed soon after by the quarrel between Guthrun and Brynhild, in which the former betrays the fact that it was Sigurth, and not Gunnar, who rode through the flames. Brynhild speaks with contempt of Guthrun and her whole family, and the following stanza, which presumably be longs to the same Sigurth lay as the Brot, is quoted at this point:\n\nSigurth the dragon | slew, and that\nWill men recall | while the world remains;\nBut little boldness | thy brother had\nTo ride or leap | the raging flames.\n\nGunnar and Sigurth alike try to appease the angry Brynhild, but in vain. After Sigurth has talked with her, his leaving her hall is described in the following stanza, introduced by the specific phrase: \"as is said in the Lay of Sigurth\":\n\nForth went Sigurth, | and speech he sought not,\nThe friend of heroes, | his head bowed down;\nSuch was his grief | that asunder burst\nHis mail-coat all | of iron wrought.\n\nBrynhild then tells Gunnar that she had given herself wholly to Sigurth before she had become Gunnar's wife (the confusion between the two stories is commented on in the note to ~<Gripisspo~>, 47), and Gunnar discusses plans of vengance with his brother, Hogni. It is at this point that the action of the ~<Brot~> begins. Beginning with this poem, and thence to the end of the cycle, the German features of the narrative predominate (cf. introductory note to ~<Gripisspo~>).\n__________________\n\n~<Hogni spake:~>\n1. \"(What evil deed | has Sigurth) done,\nThat the hero's life | thou fain wouldst have?\"\n\n[1. The fragment begins with the last words of line I (probably line 3 of the stanza). A few editors ascribe this speech to Gunnar and the next to Brynhild; one reconstruction of lines 1-2 on this probably false assumption runs: \"Why art thou, Brynhild, |]", -- removed one line before the interval, to keep everything within the window's limit

				"~<Gunnar spake:~>\n2. \"Sigurth oaths | to me hath sworn,\nOaths hath sworn, | and all hath broken;\nHe betrayed me there | where truest all\nHis oaths, methinks, | he ought to have kept.\"\n\n~<Hogni spake:~>\n3. \"Thy heart hath Brynhild | whetted to hate,\nEvil to work | and harm to win,\nShe grudges the honor | that Guthrun has,\nAnd that joy of herself | thou still dost have.\"\n\n4.

A few editors ascribe this speech to Brynhild. Gunnar, if the stanza is his, has believed Brynhild's statement regarding Sigurth's disloyalty to his blood-brother.\n\n4. The ~<Volsungasaga~> quotes a somewhat different version of this stanza, in which the snake is called \"wood-fish\" and the third line adds \"beer and many things.\" Eating snakes and the flesh of beasts of prey was commonly supposed to induce ferocity. ~<Gotthorm~>: Grimhild's son, half-brother to Gunnar. He it is who, not having sworn brotherhood with Sigurth, does the killing.\n\n5. In the manuscript this stanza stands between stanzas 11 and 12; most editions have made the change here indicated.]",

No gap is indicated in the manuscript, and some editions attach these two lines to stanza 16. ~<Niflungs~>: this name (German Nibelungen), meaning \"sons of the mist,\" seems to have belonged originally to the race of supernatural beings to which the treasure belonged in the German version. It was subsequently ex tended to include the Gjukungs and their Burgundians. This question, of minor importance in the Norse poems, has evoked an enormous amount of learned discussion in connection with the ~<Nibelungenlied~>.]",

But German men say that they killed him out of doors in the forest; and so it is told in the old Guthrun lay, that Sigurth and Gjuki's sons had ridden to the council-place, and that he was slain there. But in this they are all agreed, that they deceived him in his trust of them, and fell upon him when he was lying down and unprepared.\n\n[in this poem. The alternative version, wherein Sigurth is slain in bed, appears in ~<Sigurtharkvitha en skamma~>, ~<Guthrunarhvot~>, and ~<Hamthesmol~>, and also in the ~<Volsungasaga~>, which tells how Gotthorm tried twice to kill Sigurth but was terrified by the brightness of his eyes, and succeeded only after the hero had fallen asleep, That the annotator was correct in citing German authority for the slaying of Sigurth in the forest is shown by the ~<Nibelungenlied~> and the ~<Thithrekssaga~>.

				"~<Guthrunarkvitha I~>\n\n~<The First Lay of Guthrun~>\n\n~<Introductory Note~>\n\nThe ~<First Lay of Guthrun~>, entitled in the ~<Codex Regius~> simply ~<Guthrunarkvitha~>, immediately follows the remaining fragment of the \"long\" Sigurth lay in that manuscript. Unlike the poems dealing with the earlier part of the Sigurth cycle, the so-called ~<Reginsmol~>, ~<Fafnismol~>, and ~<Sigrdrifumol~>, it is a clear and distinct unit, apparently complete and with few and minor interpolations. It is also one of the finest poems in the entire collection, with an extraordinary emotional intensity and dramatic force. None of its stanzas are quoted elsewhere, and it is altogether probable that the compilers of the ~<Volsungasaga~> were unfamiliar with it, for they do not mention the sister and daughter of Gjuki who appear in this poem, or Herborg, \"queen of the Huns\" (stanza 6).\n\nThe lament of Guthrun (Kriemhild) is almost certainly among the oldest parts of the story. The lament was one of the earliest forms of poetry to develop among the Germanic peoples, and I suspect, though the matter is not susceptible of proof, that the lament of Sigurth's wife had assumed lyric form as early as the seventh century, and reached the North in that shape rather than in prose tradition (cf. ~<Guthrunarkvitha II~>, introductory note). We find traces of it in the seventeenth Aventiure of the ~<Nibelungenlied~>, and in the poems of the ~<Edda~> it dominates every appearance of Guthrun. The two first Guthrun lays (I and II) are both laments, one for Sigurth's death and the other including both that and the lament over the slaying of her brothers; the lament theme is apparent in the third Guthrun lay and in the ~<Guthrunarhvot~>.\n\nIn their present forms the second Guthrun lay is undoubtedly older than he first; in the prose following the ~<Brot~> the annotator refers to the \"old\" Guthrun lay in terms which can apply only to the second one in the collection. The shorter and \"first\" lay, therefore, can scarcely have been composed much before the year 1000, and may be somewhat later. The poet appears to have known and made use of the older lament; stanza 17, for example, is a close parallel to stanza 2 of the earlier poem; but whatever material he used he fitted into a definite poetic scheme of his",

				"own. And while this particular poem is, as critics have generally agreed, one of the latest of the collection, it probably represents one of the earliest parts of the entire Sigurth cycle to take on verse form.\n\n~<Guthrunarkvitha I~>, so far as the narrative underlying it is concerned, shows very little northern addition to the basic German tradition. Brynhild appears only as Guthrun's enemy and the cause of Sigurth's death; the three women who attempt to comfort Guthrun, though unknown to the southern stories, seem to have been rather distinct creations of the poet's than traditional additions to the legend. Regarding the relations of the various elements in the Sigurth cycle, cf. introductory note to ~<Gripisspo~>.\n\n__________________\n\nGuthrun sat by the dead Sigurth; she did not weep as other women, but her heart was near to bursting with grief. The men and women came to her to console her, but that was not easy to do. It is told of men that Guthrun had eaten of Fafnir's heart, and that she under stood the speech of birds. This is a poem about Guthrun.\n\n1. Then did Guthrun | think to die,\nWhen she by Sigurth | sorrowing sat;\nTears she had not, | nor wrung her hands,\nNor ever wailed, | as other women.\n\n[~<Prose~>. The prose follows the concluding prose of the ~<Brot~> without indication of a break, the heading standing immediately before stanza 1. ~<Fafnir's heart~>: this bit of information is here quite without point, and it is nowhere else stated that Guthrun understood the speech of birds. In the ~<Volsungasaga~> it is stated that Sigurth gave Guthrun some of Fafnir's heart to eat, \"and thereafter she was much grimmer than before, and wiser.\"\n\n1. This stanza seems to be based on Guthrunarkvitha II, 11-12.]",

Then Herborg spake, | the queen of the Huns:\n\n[4. ~<Gjaflaug~>: nothing further is known of this aunt of Guthrun, or of the many relatives whom she has lost. Very likely she is an invention of the poet's, for it seems improbable that other wise all further trace of her should have been lost. Line 4 has been marked by many editors as spurious.\n\n5. Some editors assume the loss of a line, after either line 1 or line 3. I prefer to believe that here and in stanza 10 the poet knew exactly what he was doing, and that both stanzas are correct.\n\n6. ~<Herborg~>: neither she nor her sorrows are elsewhere mentioned,]",

Herborg appears from stanza 11 to have been the foster-mother of Gollrond, Guthrun's sister. Lines 5-7 may be interpolations, or may form a separate stanza.\n\n7.

That desire for Sigurth's treasure (the gold cursed by Andvari and Loki) was one of the motives for his murder is indicated in ~<Sigurtharkvitha en skamma~> (stanza 16), and was clearly a part of the German tradition, as it appears in the ~<Nibelungenlied~>.\n\n21.

Editors are agreed that this stanza shows interpolations, but differ as to the lines to reject. Line 4 (literally \"every wave of ill-doing drives thee\") is substantially a proverb, and line 5, with its apparently meaningless reference to \"seven\" kings, may easily have come from some other source.\n\n24. The stanza is obviously in bad shape; perhaps it represents two separate stanzas, or perhaps three of the lines are later additions. ~<Atli~>: Brynhild here blames her brother, following the frequent custom of transferring the responsibility for a murder (cf. ~<Helgakvitha Hundingsbana II~>, 33), because he compelled her to marry Gunnar against her will, an idea which the poet seems to have gained from ~<Sigurtharkvitha en skamma~>, 32-39. These stanzas represent an entirely different version of the story, wherein Atli, attacked by Gunnar and Sigurth, buys them off by giving Gunnar his sister, Brynhild, as wife. He seems to have induced the latter to marry Gunnar by falsely telling her that Gunnar was Sigurth (a rationalistic explanation of the interchange of forms described in the ~<Volsungasaga~> and ~<Gripisspo~>, 37-39). In the present stanza Atli is made to do this out of desire for Sigurth's treasure. ~<Hunnish race~>: this may be]",

Brynhild would not live after Sigurth. She had eight of her thralls slain and five serving-women. Then she killed her self with a sword, as is told in the Short Lay of Sigurth.\n\n[merely an error (neither Gunnar nor Sigurth could properly have been connected in any way with Atli and his Huns), based on ~<Sigurtharkvitha en skamma~>, wherein Sigurth appears more than once as the \"Hunnish king.\" The North was very much in the dark as to the differences between Germans, Burgundians, Franks, Goths, and Huns, and used the words without much discrimination. On the other hand, it may refer to Sigurth's appearance when, adorned with gold, he came with Gunnar to besiege Atli, in the alternative version of the story just cited (cf. ~<Sigurtharkvitha en skamma~>, 36). ~<Flame of the snake's bed~>: gold, so called because serpents and dragons were the' traditional guardians of treasure, on which they lay.\n\n~<Prose~>. The manuscript has \"Gunnar\" in place of \"Guthrun,\" but this is an obvious mistake; the entire prose passage is based on ~<Guthrunarkvitha II~>, 14.

				"~<Sigurtharkvitha En Skamma~>\n\n~<The Short Lay of Sigurth~>\n\n~<Introductory Note~>\n\n~<Guthrunarkvitha I~> is immediately followed in the ~<Codex Regius~> by a long poem which in the manuscript bears the heading \"Sigurtharkvitha,\" but which is clearly referred to in the prose link between it and ~<Guthrunarkvitha I~> as the \"short\" Lay of Sigurth. The discrepancy between this reference and the obvious length of the poem has led to many conjectures, but the explanation seems to be that the \"long\" Sigurth lay, of which the ~<Brot~> is presumably a part, was materially longer even than this poem. The efforts to reduce the \"short\" Sigurth lay to dimensions which would justify the appellation in comparison with other poems in the collection, either by separating it into two poems or by the rejection of many stanzas as interpolations, have been utterly inconclusive.\n\nAlthough there are probably several interpolated passages, and indications of omissions are not lacking, the poem as we now have it seems to be a distinct and coherent unit. From the narrative point of view it leaves a good deal to be desired, for the reason that the poet's object was by no means to tell a story, with which his hearers were quite familiar, but to use the narrative simply as the background for vivid and powerful characterization. The lyric element, as Mogk points out, overshadows the epic throughout, and the fact that there are frequent confusions of narrative tradition does not trouble the poet at all.\n\nThe material on which the poem was based seems to have existed in both prose and verse form; the poet was almost certainly familiar with some of the other poems in the Eddic collection, with poems which have since been lost, and with the narrative prose traditions which never fully assumed verse form. The fact that he seems to have known and used the ~<Oddrunargratr~>, which can hardly have been composed before 1050, and that in any case he introduces the figure of Oddrun, a relatively late addition to the story, dates the poem as late as the end of the eleventh century, or even the first half of the twelfth. There has been much discussion as to where it was composed, the debate centering chiefly on the reference to glaciers (stanza 8). There is something to be said in favor of Greenland",

				"as the original home of the poem (cf. introductory note to ~<Atlakvitha~>), but the arguments for Iceland are even stronger; Norway in this case is practically out of the question.\n\nThe narrative features of the poem are based on the German rather than the Norse elements of the story (cf. introductory note to ~<Gripisspo~>), but the poet has taken whatever material he wanted without much discrimination as to its source. By the year 1100 the story of Sigurth, with its allied legends, existed through out the North in many and varied forms, and the poem shows traces of variants of the main story which do not appear elsewhere.\n\n1. Of old did Sigurth | Gjuki seek,\nThe Volsung young, | in battles victor;\nWell he trusted | the brothers twain,\nWith mighty oaths | among them sworn.\n\n2.

On the episode of the sword cf. ~<Gripisspo~>, 41 and note.

This stanza may refer, as Gering thinks, merely to the fact that Brynhild lived happy and unsuspecting as Gunnar's wife until the fatal quarrel with Guthrun (cf. ~<Gripisspo~>, 45 and note) revealed to her the deceit whereby she had been won, or it may refer to the version of the story which appears in stanzas 32-39, wherein Brynhild lived happily with Atli, her brother, until he was attacked by Gunnar and Sigurth, and was compelled to give his sister to Gunnar, winning her consent thereto by representing] ",

That she had loved Sigurth from the outset (cf. stanza 40) fits well with the version of the story wherein Sigurth meets her before he comes to Gunnar's home (the version not used in this poem), or the one outlined in the note on stanza 5, but does not accord with the story of Sigurth's first meeting Brynhild in Gunnar's form-an added reason for believing that the poet in stanzas 5-6 had in mind the story represented by stanzas 32-39. ~<The hero~>: the manuscript originally had the phrase thus, then corrected it to \"though I die,\" and finally crossed out the correction.

This stanza has been the subject of many conjectural emendations. Some editions assume a gap after line 2, and make a separate stanza of lines 3-7; others mark lines 5-7 as spurious. The stanza seems to have been expanded by repetition. ~<Grief~> (line 1): the manuscript has \"wrath,\" involving a metrical error.\n\n14. Bugge and Gering transfer lines 4-5 to the beginning of stanza 16, on the basis of the ~<Volsungasaga~> paraphrase, and assume a gap of one line after line 3. Line 5, which is in the nature of a stereotyped clause, may well be interpolated.\n\n15. After \"Buthli\" in line 2 the manuscript has \"my brother,\" apparently a scribal error. In line 4 the manuscript has \"wealth\" instead of \"love,\" apparently with stanza 10, in mind, but the ~<Volsungasaga~> paraphrase has \"love,\" and many editors have suspected an error.\n\n16. Cf. note on stanza 14. After thus adding lines 4-5 of]",

That greed for Sigurth's wealth was one of the motives for his slaying is indicated likewise in ~<Guthrunarkvitha I~>, 20, and in the German versions of the story.\n\n18. ~<We four~>: if line 1 of stanza 19 is spurious, or the reference therein to \"five\" is a blunder, as may well be the case, then the \"four\" are Sigurth and the three brothers, Gunnar, Hogni, and Gotthorm. But it may be that the poet had in mind a tradition which, as in the ~<Thithrekssaga~>, gave Gjuki a fourth son, in which case the \"four\" refers only to the four Gjukungs. ~<Hunnish hero~>: Sigurth; cf. stanza 4 and note. Some editions put line 4 between lines 1 and 2. Some add lines 1-2 of stanza 19 to stanza 18, marking them as spurious.\n\n19. ~<We five~>: see note on preceding stanza. Some editors mark]",

The manuscript does not name the speaker. ~<Gotthorm~> (the name is variously spelt): half-brother of Gunnar and Hogni (cf. ~<Hyndluljoth~>, 27 and note, and ~<Brot~>, 4 and note). The name is the northern form of Gundomar; a prince of this name is mentioned in the ~<Lex Burgundionum~>, apparently as a brother of Gundahari (Gundicarius). In the ~<Nibelungenlied~> the third brother is called Gernot.\n\n21. No gap is indicated in the manuscript, and many editors combine stanza 21 with stanza 22, but it seems likely that not only two lines, but one or more stanzas in addition, have been lost; cf. ~<Brot~>, 4, and also the detailed account of the slaying of Sigurth in the ~<Volsungasaga~>, wherein, as here, Sigurth is killed in his bed (cf. stanza 24) and not in the forest.\n\n22. Some editions combine lines 3-4 with stanza 23. ~<Gram~>:]",

A line may well have been lost from this stanza.\n\n24. ~<Freyr~>: if the phrase \"the friend of Freyr\" means any thing more than \"king\" (cf. ~<Rigsthula~>, 46 etc.), which I doubt, it has reference to the late tradition that Freyr, and not Othin, was the ancestor of the Volsungs (cf. ~<Helgakvitha Hundingsbana I~>, 57 and note).\n\n25. Müllenhoff thinks this stanza, or at any rate lines 1-2, a later addition based on stanza 29.\n\n26. ~<My son~>: Sigmund; cf. stanza 12 and note, and also ~<Brot~>, 9 and note.]",

Sigurth means that although Guthrun may have seven sons by a later marriage, none of them will equal Sigmund, \"son of their (i.e., Gunnar's and Hogni's) sister.\" ~<Thing~>: council.\n\n28. Sigurth's protestation of guiltlessness fits perfectly with the story of his relations with Brynhild used in this poem, but not, of course, with the alternative version, used in the ~<Gripisspo~> and elsewhere, wherein Sigurth meets Brynhild before he woos her for Gunnar, and they have a daughter, Aslaug.\n\n29. Cf. ~<Guthrunarkvitha I~>, 115.\n\n30. Cf. ~<Brot~>, 10.]",

Line 1 may well be a mere expansion of \"Gunnar spake.\" The manuscript marks line 4 as the beginning of a new stanza, and some editions combine lines 4-5 with stanza 32.\n\n32. This stanza, which all editors have accepted as an integral part of the poem, apparently refers to the same story represented by stanzas 37-39, which most editors have (I believe mistakenly) marked as interpolated. As is pointed out in the notes on stanzas 3, 5, 6 and 10, the poet throughout seems to have accepted the version of the story wherein Gunnar and Sigurth besiege Atli, and are bought off by the gift of Atli's sister, Brynhild, to Gunnar as wife, her consent being won by Atli's representation that Gunnar is Sigurth (cf. also ~<Guthrunarkvitha I~>, 24 and note).\n\n33. The manuscript does not name the speaker, and some editions add a first line: \"Then Brynhild, daughter | of Buthli, spake.\"]",

Cf. stanza 5.\n\n35. ~<Three kings~>: Gunnar, Hogni, and Sigurth.\n\n36. Some editions place this stanza after stanza 39, on the theory that stanzas 37-39 are interpolated. Line 4, as virtually a repetition of line 3, has generally been marked as spurious. In this version of the winning of Brynhild it appears that Atli pointed out Sigurth as Gunnar, and Brynhild promptly fell in love with the hero whom, as he rode on ~<Grani~> and was decked with some of the spoils taken from Fafnir, she recognized as the dragon's slayer. Thus no change of form between Sigurth and Gunnar was necessary. The oath to marry Gunnar had to be carried out even after Brynhild had discovered the deception.\n\n37. Most editors mark stanzas 37-39 as interpolated, but cf. note on stanza 32. Stanza 37 has been variously emended. Lines 4 and 6 look like interpolated repetitions, but many editors make]",

After line I Grundtvig adds: \"Son of Buthli, | and brother of mine.\" After line 6 Bugge adds: \"Not thou was it, Gunnar, | who Grani rode, / Though thou my brother | with rings didst buy.\" Regarding Brynhild's wealth cf. stanza 10 and note.\n\n38. Brynhild here again appears as a Valkyrie. The manuscript marks line 4 as the beginning of a new stanza. Any one of the last three lines may be spurious.\n\n39. Some editions combine this stanza with lines 4-5 of stanza 38, with lines 1-2 of stanza 40, or with the whole of stanza 40. ~<The bond~>: Brynhild thought she was marrying Sigurth, owner of the treasure, whereas she was being tricked into marrying Gunnar.]",

But back she cast | all those who came,\nNor from the long road | let them hold her;\n\n[41. At this point there seem to be several emissions. Brynhild's statement in lines 1-2 seems to refer to the episode, not here mentioned but told in detail in the ~<Volsungasaga~>, of Sigurth's effort to repair the wrong that has been done her by himself giving up Guthrun in her favor, an offer which she refuses. The lacuna here suggested, which is not indicated in the manuscript, may be simply a single line (line 1) or a stanza or more. After line 2 there is almost certainly a gap of at least one stanza, and possibly more, in which Brynhild states her determination to die.\n\n42. Hardly any two editions agree as to the arrangement of the lines in stanzas 42-44. I have followed the manuscript except in transposing line 4 of stanza 43 to this position from the place it holds in the manuscript after line 4 of stanza 14. All the other involve the rejection of two or more lines as spurious and the assumption of various gaps. Gering and Sijmons both arrange the lines thus: 42, 1-2; two-line gap; 43, 3]",

Perhaps the remains of two stanzas; the manuscript marks line 4 as the beginning of a new stanza, and after line 4 an added line has been suggested: \"She was ever known for evil thoughts.\" On the other hand, line 1, identical with line 31 of stanza 17, may well be a mere expansion of \"Hogni spake,\" and line 6 may have been introduced, with a slight variation, from line 5 of stanza 38. ~<Born again~>: this looks like a trace of Christian influence (the poem was composed well after the coming of Christianity to Iceland) in the assumption that if Brynhild killed herself she could not be \"born again\" (cf. concluding prose to ~<Helgakvitha Hundingsbana II~>).\n\n46. The manuscript marks line 3 as beginning a stanza; some]",

The manuscript marks line 3, and not line 1, as beginning a stanza, and some editions treat lines 3-4 as a separate stanza, or combine them with stanza 48.\n\n48. Brynhild means, as stanzas 49-51 show, that those of her women who wish to win rewards must be ready to follow her in death. The word translated \"women\" in line 1 is conjectural, but the general meaning is clear enough.\n\n49. In place of \"as so she spake\" in line 1 the manuscript has]",

No gap indicated in the manuscript; many editions place it between lines 3 and 4. ~<Menja's wealth~>: gold; the story of the mill Grotti, whereby the giantesses Menja and Fenja ground gold for King Frothi, is told in the ~<Grottasongr~>.\n\n52. With this stanza begins Brynhild's prophesy of what is to befall Gunnar, Guthrun, Atli, and the many others involved in their fate. Line 3 is a proverbial expression meaning simply \"your troubles are not at an end.\"\n\n53. No gap is indicated in the manuscript; one suggestion for line 2 runs: \"Grimhild shall make her | to laugh once]",

Probably a line has been lost from this stanza. Grundtvig adds as a new first line: \"Her shalt thou find in the hall of Half.\" Some editions query line 3 as possibly spurious. ~<Svanhild~>: the figure of Svanhild is exceedingly old. The name means \"Swan-Maiden-Warrior,\" applying to just such mixtures of swan-maiden and Valkyrie as appear in the ~<Völundarkvitha~>. Originally part of a separate tradition, Svanhild appears first to have been incorporated in the Jormunrek (Ermanarich) story as the unhappy wife of that monarch, and much later to have been identified as the daughter of Sigurth and Guthrun, thus linking the two sets of legends.\n\n55. Line 2 in the original is almost totally obscure. Line 4 should very possibly precede line 2, while line 5 looks like an unwarranted addition.\n\n56. This stanza probably ought to follow stanza 52, as it refers solely to) the winning of Brynhild by Gunnar and Sigurth. Müllenhoff regards stanzas 53-55 as interpolated. The manuscript indicates no gap after line 3.]",

Stanzas 57-58 seem to be the remains of two stanzas, but the ~<Volsungasaga~> paraphrase follows closely the form here given. Line 3 may well be spurious; line 5 has likewise been questioned. ~<Oddrun~>: this sister of Atli and Brynhild, known mainly through the ~<Oddrunargratr~>, is a purely northern addition to the cycle, and apparently one of a relatively late date. She figures solely by reason of her love affair with Gunnar.\n\n58. Possibly two lines have been lost; many editions combine the two remaining lines with lines 1-3 of stanza 59. Concerning the manner of Gunnar's death cf. ~<Drap Niflunga~>.\n\n59. Line 3 may well be spurious, as it is largely repetition. The manuscript has \"sofa\" (\"sleep\") in place of \"sona\" (\"sons\"), but the ~<Volsungasaga~> paraphrase says clearly \"sons.\" The slaying of Atli by Guthrun in revenge for his killing of her brothers is told in the two Atli lays. The manuscript marks line 4 as the beginning of a new stanza, and some editions make a separate stanza out of lines 4-5, or else combine them with stanza 60.\n\n60. ~<To follow in death~>: this phrase is not in ~<Regius~>, but is]",

In place of lines 3-4 the manuscript has one line \"Two at his head, and a pair of hawks\"; the addition is made from the ~<Volsungasaga~> paraphrase. The burning or burying of slaves or beasts to accompany their masters in death was a general custom in the North.

				"~<Helreith Brynhildar~>\n\n~<Brynhild's Hell-Ride~>\n\n~<Introductory Note~>\n\nThe little ~<Helreith Brynhildar~> immediately follows the \"short\" Sigurth lay in the ~<Codex~> ~<Regius~>, being linked to it by the brief prose note; the heading, \"Brynhild's Ride on Hel-Way,\" stands just before the first stanza. The entire poem, with the exception of stanza. 6, is likewise quoted in the ~<Nornageststhattr~>. Outside of one stanza (No. 11), which is a fairly obvious interpolation, the poem possesses an extraordinary degree of dramatic unity, and, certain pedantic commentators notwithstanding, it is one of the most vivid and powerful in the whole collection. None the less, it has been extensively argued that parts of it belonged originally to the so-called ~<Sigrdrifumol~>. That it stands in close relation to this poem is evident enough, but it is difficult to believe that such a masterpiece of dramatic poetry was ever the result of mere compilation. It seems more reasonable to regard the ~<Helreith~>, with the exception of stanza 11 and allowing for the loss of two lines from stanza 6, as a complete and carefully constructed unit, based undoubtedly on older poems, but none the less an artistic creation in itself.\n\nThe poem is generally dated as late as the eleventh century, and the concluding stanza betrays Christian influence almost unmistakably. It shows the confusion of traditions manifest in all the later poems; for example, Brynhild is here not only a Valkyrie but also a swan-maiden. Only three stanzas have any reference to the Guthrun-Gunnar part of the story; otherwise the poem is concerned solely with the episode of Sigurth's finding the sleeping Valkyrie. Late as it is, therefore, it is essentially a Norse creation, involving very few of the details of the German cycle (cf. introductory note to ~<Gripisspo~>).\n\n__________________\n\nAfter the death of Brynhild there were made two bale-fires, the one for Sigurth, and that burned first, and on the other was Brynhild burned, and she was on a",

				"wagon which was covered with a rich cloth. Thus it is told, that Brynhild went in the wagon on Hel-way, and passed by a house where dwelt a certain giantess. The giantess spake:\n\n1. \"Thou shalt not further | forward fare,\nMy dwelling ribbed | with rocks across;\nMore seemly it were | at thy weaving to stay,\nThan another's husband | here to follow.\n\n2. \"What wouldst thou have | from Valland here,\nFickle of heart, | in this my house?\nGold-goddess, now, | if thou wouldst know,\nHeroes' blood | from thy hands hast washed.\"\n\n~<Brynhild spake:~>\n3. \"Chide me not, woman | from rocky walls,\nThough to battle once | I was wont to go;\nBetter than thou | I shall seem to be,\nWhen men us two | shall truly know.\"\n\n~<The giantess spake:~>\n4. \"Thou wast, Brynhild, | Buthli's daughter,\n\n[~<Prose~>. The prose follows the last stanza of ~<Sigurtharkvitha en skamma~> without break. ~<Two~> ~<bale-fires~>: this contradicts the statement made in the concluding stanzas of ~<Sigurtharkvitha~> ~<en~> ~<skamma~>, that Sigurth and Brynhild were burned on the same pyre; there is no evidence that the annotator here had anything but his own mistaken imagination to go on.\n\n2. ~<Valland~>: this name (\"Land of Slaughter\") is used else where of mythical places; cf. ~<Harbarthsljoth~>, 24, and prose introduction to ~<Völundarkvitha~>; it may here not be a proper name at all, ~<Gold-goddess~>: poetic circumlocution for \"woman.\"]",

				"For the worst of evils | born in the world;\nTo death thou hast given | Gjuki's children,\nAnd laid their lofty | house full low.\"\n\n~<Brynhild spake:~>\n5. \"Truth from the wagon | here I tell thee,\nWitless one, | if know thou wilt\nHow the heirs of Gjuki | gave me to be\njoyless ever, | a breaker of oaths.\n\n6. \"Hild the helmed | in Hlymdalir\nThey named me of old, | all they who knew me.\n. . . . .  . . . . .\n. . . . .  . . . . .\n\n7. \"The monarch bold | the swan-robes bore\nOf the sisters eight | beneath an oak;\n\n[6. In ~<Regius~> these two lines stand after stanza 7, but most editions; place them as here. They are not quoted in the ~<Nornageststhattr~>. Presumably two lines, and perhaps more, have been lost. It has frequently been argued that all or part of the passage from stanza 6 through stanza 10 (6-10, 7-10 or 8-10) comes originally from the so-called ~<Sigrdrifumol~>, where it would undoubtedly fit exceedingly well. ~<Hild~>: a Valkyrie name meaning \"Fighter\" (cf. ~<Voluspo~>, 31). in such compound names as Brynhild (\"Fighter in Armor\") the first element was occasionally omitted. ~<Hlymdalir~> (\"Tumult-Dale\"): a mythical name, merely signifying the place of battle as the home of Valkyries.\n\n7. Regarding the identification of swan-maidens with Valkyries, and the manner in which men could get them in their power by stealing their swan-garments, cf. ~<Völundarkvitha~>, introductory prose and note, where the same thing happens. ~<The monarch~>: perhaps Agnar, brother of Autha, mentioned in Sigrdrifumol (prose and quoted verse following stanza 4) as the warrior for]",

				"Twelve winters I was, | if know thou wilt,\nWhen oaths I yielded | the king so young.\n\n8. \"Next I let | the leader of Goths,\nHjalmgunnar the old, | go down to hell,\nAnd victory brought | to Autha's brother;\nFor this was Othin's | anger mighty.\n\n9. \"He beset me with shields | in Skatalund,\nRed and white, | their rims o'erlapped;\nHe bade that my sleep | should broken be\nBy him who fear | had nowhere found.\n\n10. \"He let round my hall, | that southward looked,\nThe branches' foe | high-leaping burn;\nAcross it he bade | the hero come\nWho brought me the gold | that Fafnir guarded\n\n11.

One ~<Nornageststhattr~> manuscript has \"brother of the giantess\" in place of \"leader of Goths.\"\n\n9. Cf. ~<Sigrdrifumol~>, prose introduction. ~<Skatalund~> (\"Warriors' Grove\"): a mythical name; elsewhere the place where Brynhild lay is called Hindarfjoll.\n\n10. ~<Branches' foe~>: fire. Regarding the treasure cf. ~<Fafnismol~>.\n\n11. This stanza is presumably an interpolation, reflecting a different version of the story, wherein Sigurth meets Brynhild at the home of her brother-in-law and foster-father, Heimir (cf.]",

Perhaps this is a curious relic of the Helgi tradition.\n\n12. ~<Eight nights~>: elsewhere (cf. ~<Gripisspo~>, 4.2) the time is stated as three nights, not eight. There is a confusion of traditions here, as in ~<Gripisspo~>. In the version of the story wherein Sigurth met Brynhild before he encountered the Gjukungs, Sigurth was bound by no oaths, and the union was completed; it is only in the alternative version that the episode of the sword laid between the two occurs.\n\n14. The idea apparently conveyed in the concluding lines, that Sigurth and Brynhild will be together in some future life, is utterly out of keeping with the Norse pagan traditions, and the whole stanza indicates the influence of Christianity.]"

				"~<Guthrunarkvitha II, En Forna~>\n\n~<The Second, or Old, Lay of Guthrun~>\n\n~<Introductory Note~>\n\nIt has already been pointed out (introductory note to ~<Guthrunarkvitha I~>) that the tradition of Guthrun's lament was known wherever the Sigurth story existed, and that this lament was probably one of the earliest parts of the legend to assume verse form. Whether it reached the North as verse cannot, of course, be determined, but it is at least possible that this was the case, and in any event it is clear that by the tenth and eleventh centuries there were a number of Norse poems with Guthrun's lament as the central theme. Two of these are included in the Eddic collection, the second one being unquestionably much the older. It is evidently the poem referred to by the annotator in the prose note following the ~<Brot~> as \"the old Guthrun lay,\" and its character and state of preservation have combined to lead most commentators to date it as early as the first half of the tenth century, whereas ~<Guthrunarkvitha I~> belongs a hundred years later.\n\nThe poem has evidently been preserved in rather bad shape, with a number of serious omissions and some interpolations, but in just this form it lay before the compilers of the ~<Volsungasaga~>, who paraphrased it faithfully, and quoted five of its stanzas. The interpolations are on the whole unimportant; the omissions, while they obscure the sense of certain passages, do not destroy the essential continuity of the poem, in which Guthrun reviews her sorrows from the death of Sigurth through the slaying of her brothers to Atli's dreams foretelling the death of their sons. It is, indeed, the only Norse poem of the Sigurth cycle antedating the year 1000 which has come down to us in anything approaching complete form; the ~<Reginsmol~>, ~<Fafnismol~>, and ~<Sigrdrifumol~> are all collections of fragments, only a short bit of the \"long\" Sigurth lay remains, and the others--~<Gripisspo~>, ~<Guthrunarkvitha I~> and ~<III~>, ~<Sigurtharkvitha en skamma~>, ~<Helreith Brynhildar~>, ~<Oddrunargratr~>, ~<Guthrunarhvot~>, ~<Hamthesmol~>, and the two Atli lays--are all generally dated from the eleventh and even the twelfth centuries.\n\nAn added reason for believing that ~<Guthrunarkvitha II~> traces its origin back to a lament which reached the North",

				"from Germany in verse form is the absence of most characteristic Norse additions to the narrative, except in minor details. Sigurth is slain in the forest, as \"German men say\" (cf. ~<Brot~>, concluding prose); the urging of Guthrun by her mother 2nd brothers to become Atli's wife, the slaying of the Gjukungs (here only intimated, for at that point something seems to have been lost), and Guthrun's prospective revenge on Atli, all belong directly to the German tradition (cf. introductory note to ~<Gripisspo~>).\n\nIn the ~<Codex Regius~> the poem is entitled simply ~<Guthrunarkvitha~>; the numeral has been added in nearly all editions to distinguish this poem from the other two Guthrun lays, and the phrase \"the old\" is borrowed from the annotator's comment in the prose note at the end of the ~<Brot~>.\n\n__________________\n\nKing Thjothrek was with Atli, and had lost most of his men. Thjothrek and Guthrun lamented their griefs together. She spoke to him, saying:\n\n1. A maid of maids | my mother bore me,\nBright in my bower, | my brothers I loved,\nTill Gjuki dowered | me with gold,\nDowered with gold, | and to Sigurth gave me.\n\n[~<Prose~>. ~<Thjothrek~>: the famous Theoderich, king of the Ostrogoths, who became renowned in German story as Dietrich von Bern. The German tradition early accepted the anachronism of bringing together Attila (Etzel, Atli), who died in 453, and Theoderich. who was born about 455, and adding thereto Ermanarich (Jormunrek), king of the Goths, who died about 376. Ermanarich, in German tradition, replaced Theoderich's actual enemy, Odovakar, and it was in battle with Jormunrek (i. e., Odovakar) that Thjothrek is here said to have lost most WE his men. The annotator found the material for this note in ~<Guthrunarkvitha III~>, in which Guthrun is accused of having Thjothrek as her lover. At the time when ~<Guthrunarkvitha II~>]",

The story of how Gotthorm, was slain after killing Sigurth in his bed is told in ~<Sigurtharkvitha~> ~<en~> ~<skamma~>, 22-23, and in the ~<Volsungasaga~>.\n\n11.

Bugge fills out the stanza thus: \"The wolves were howling | on all the ways, / The eagles cried as their food they craved.\"\n\n13. Cf. note on preceding stanza. Grundtvig suggests as a first line: \"Long did I bide, | my brothers awaiting.\" Many editors reject line 4.\n\n14. The manuscript marks line 3 as beginning a stanza, and many editions combine lines 3-4 with lines 1-2 of stanza 15 Hoalf (or Half): Gering thinks this Danish king may be identical with Alf, son of King Hjalprek, and second husband of Hjordis, Sigurth's mother (cf. ~<Fra Dautha Sinfjotla~> and note), but the name was a common one. ~<Thora~> and ~<Hokon~> have not been identified (cf. ~<Guthrunarkvitha I~>, concluding prose, which is clearly based on this stanza). A Thora appears in ~<Hyndluljoth~>, 18, as the wife of Dag, one of the sons of Halfdan the Old, the most famous of Denmark's mythical kings, and one of her sons is Alf (Hoalf?).]",

No gap is indicated in the manuscript, and most editions combine these two lines either with lines 3-4 of stanza 16, with lines 1-2 of stanza 18, or with the whole of stanza 18. Line 2]",

The ~<Volsungasaga~> paraphrase indicates that these two lines are the remains of a full stanza, the prose passage running: \"Now Guthrun was some what comforted of her sorrows. Then Grimhild learned where Guthrun was now dwelling.\" The first two lines may be the ones missing. ~<Gothic~>: the term \"Goth\" was used in the North without much discrimination to apply to all south-Germanic peoples. In ~<Gripisspo~>, 35, Gunnar, Grimhild's son, appears as \"lord of the Goths.\"\n\n18. The manuscript marks line 3 as the beginning of a stanza. Grimhild is eager to have amends made to Guthrun for the slaying of Sigurth and their son, Sigmund, because Atli has threatened war if he cannot have Guthrun for his wife.\n\n19. Lines 5-6 are almost certainly interpolations, made by a scribe with a very vague understanding of the meaning of the stanza, which refers simply to the journey of the Gjukungs to bring their sister home from Denmark.\n\n20. Lines 1-2 are probably interpolated, though the ~<Volsungasaga~> includes the names. Some one apparently attempted to]",

A draught did Grimhild | give me to drink,\nBitter and cold; | I forgot my cares;\n\n[supply the names of Atli's messengers, the \"long-beard men\" of line 4, who have come to ask for Guthrun's hand. Some commentators assume, as the Volsungasaga does, that these messengers went with the Gjukungs to Denmark in search of Guthrun, but it seems more likely that a transitional stanza has dropped out after stanza 19, and that Guthrun received Atli's emissaries in her brothers' home. ~<Long-beards~>: the word may actually mean Langobards or Lombards, but, if it does, it is presumably without any specific significance here. Certainly the names in the interpolated two lines do not fit either Lombards or Huns, for Valdar is identified as a Dane, and Jarizleif and Jarizskar are apparently Slavic. The manuscript indicates line 5 as beginning a new stanza.\n\n21. ~<Each~>: the reference is presumably to Gunnar and Hogni, and perhaps also Grimhild, I suspect that this stanza belongs before stanza 20.\n\n22. Stanzas 22-25 describe the draught of forgetfulness which Grimhild gives Guthrun, just as she gave one to Sigurth (in one version of the story) to make him forget Brynhild. The draught does not seem to work despite Guthrun's statement in stanza 25 (cf. stanza 30), for which reason Vigfusson, not unwisely, places stanzas 22-25 after stanza 34. ~<Blood~> ~<of~> ~<swine~>: cf. ~<Hyndluljoth~>, 39 and note.]",

It is possible that the comma should follow \"heather fish,\" making the \"ear uncut\" (of grain) come from the world of the dead.\n\n24. ~<Dew of the hearth~>: soot.\n\n25. In the manuscript, and in some editions, the first line is in the third person plural: \"Then they forgot, when the draught they had drunk.\" The second line in the original is manifestly in bad shape, and has been variously emended. I forgot: this emendation is doubtful, in view of stanza 30, but cf. note to stanza 22. The kings all three: probably Atli's emissaries, though the interpolated lines of stanza 20 name four of them.

But some editions omit the \"thy,\" and if Atli, and not Grimhild, is speaking (cf. note on stanza 25), the reference may be, as in line 3 of stanza 27, to the wealth of Atli's father, Buthli. ~<Hlothver~>: the northern form of the Frankish name Chlodowech (Ludwig), but who this Hlothver was, beyond the fact that he was evidently a Frankish king, is uncertain. If Atli is speaking, he is presumably a Frankish ruler whose land Atli and his Huns have conquered.\n\n27. Cf. note on stanza 25 as to the probable speaker.\n\n28.

This stanza presents a strong argument for transposing the description of the draught of forgetfulness (stanzas 22-24 and lines 1-2 of stanza 25) to follow stanza 33. ~<Raven~>, etc.: the original is somewhat obscure, and the line may refer simply to the \"corpse-eating raven.\" 32.

Line 5, which the manuscript marks as be ginning a stanza, is probably spurious.\n\n37. After these two lines there appears to be a considerable gap, the lost stanzas giving Guthrun's story of the slaying of her brothers. It is possible that stanzas 38-45 came originally from another poem, dealing with Atli's dream, and were here substituted for the original conclusion of Guthrun's lament. Many editions combine stanzas 37 and 38, or combine stanza 38 (the manuscript marks line I as beginning a stanza) with lines 1-2 of stanza 39.\n\n39. The manuscript indicates line 3 as the beginning of a stanza. The manuscript and most editions do not indicate the speakers in this and the following stanzas.]",

				"~<Guthrun spake:~>\n40. \"Fire a dream | of steel shall follow\nAnd willful pride | one of woman's wrath;\nA baneful sore | I shall burn from thee,\nAnd tend and heal thee, | though hated thou am\"\n\n~<Atli spake:~>\n41. \"Of plants I dreamed, | in the garden drooping,\nThat fain would I have | full high to grow;\nPlucked by the roots, | and red with blood,\nThey brought them hither, | and bade me eat.\n\n42. \"I dreamed my hawks | from my hand had flown,\nEager for food, | to an evil house;\nI dreamed their hearts | with honey I ate,\nSoaked in blood, | and heavy my sorrow.\n\n43. \"Hounds I dreamed | from my hand I loosed,\nLoud in hunger | and pain they howled;\nTheir flesh methought | was eagles' food,\nAnd their bodies now | I needs must eat.\"\n\n~<Guthrun spake:~>\n44. \"Men shall soon | of sacrifice speak,\n\n[40. Guthrun, somewhat obscurely, interprets Atli's first dream (stanza 39) to mean that she will cure him of an abscess by cauterizing it. Her interpretation is, of course, intended merely to blind him to her purpose.\n\n41. In stanzas 41-43 Atli's dreams forecast the death of his two sons, whose flesh Guthrun gives him to eat (cf. ~<Atlakvitha~>, 39, and ~<Atlamol~>, 78).\n\n44. This stanza is evidently Guthrun's intentionally cryptic]",

				"And off the heads | of beasts shall hew\nDie they shall | ere day has dawned,\nA few nights hence, | and the folk shall have them.\"\n\n~<Atli spake:~>\n45. \"On my bed I sank, | nor slumber sought,\nWeary with woe,-- | full well I remember.\n. . . . .  . . . . .\n\n[interpretation of Atli's dreams, but the meaning of the original is more than doubtful. The word here rendered \"sacrifice\" may mean \"sea-catch,\" and the one rendered \"beasts\" may mean \"whales.\" None of the attempted emendations have rendered the stanza really intelligible, but it appears to mean that Atli will soon make a sacrifice of beasts at night, and give their bodies to the people. Guthrun of course has in mind the slaying of his two sons.\n\n45. With these two lines the poem abruptly ends; some editors assign the speech to Atli (I think rightly), others to Guthrun. Ettmüller combines the lines with stanza 38. Whether stanzas 38-45 originally belonged to Guthrun's lament, or were interpolated here in place of the lost conclusion of that poem from another one dealing with Atli's dreams (cf. note on stanza 37), it is clear that the end has been lost.]"

				"~<Guthrunarkvitha III~>\n\n~<The Third Lay of Guthrun~>\n\n~<Introductory Note~>\n\nThe short ~<Guthrunarkvitha III~>, entitled in the manuscript simply Guthrunarkvitha, but so numbered in most editions to distinguish it from the first and second Guthrun lays, appears only in the ~<Codex Regius~>. It is neither quoted nor paraphrased in the ~<Volsungasaga~>, the compilers of which appear not to have known the story with which it deals. The poem as we have it is evidently complete and free from serious interpolations. It can safely be dated from the first half of the eleventh century, for the ordeal by boiling water, with which it is chiefly concerned, was first introduced into Norway by St. Olaf, who died in 1030, and the poem speaks of it in stanza 7 as still of foreign origin.\n\nThe material for the poem evidently came from North Germany, but there is little indication that the poet was working on the basis of a narrative legend already fully formed. The story of the wife accused of faithlessness who proves her innocence by the test of boiling water had long been current in Germany, as elsewhere, and had attached itself to various women of legendary fame, but not except in this poem, so far as we can judge, to Guthrun (Kriemhild). The introduction of Thjothrek (Theoderich, Dietrich, Thithrek) is another indication of relative lateness, for the legends of Theoderich do not appear to have reached the North materially before the year 1000. On the anachronism of bringing Thjothrek to Atli's court cf. ~<Guthrunarkvitha II~>, introductory prose, note, in which the development of the Theoderich tradition in its relation to that of Atli is briefly outlined.\n\n~<Guthrunarkvitha III~> is, then, little more than a dramatic German story made into a narrative lay by a Norse poet, with the names of Guthrun, Atli, Thjothrek, and Herkja incorporated for the sake of greater effectiveness. Its story probably nowhere formed a part of the living tradition of Sigurth and Atli, but the poem has so little distinctively Norse coloring that it may Possibly have been based on a story or even a poem which its composer heard in Germany or from the lips of a German narrator.",

				"__________________\n\nHerkja was the name of a serving-woman of Atli's; she had been his concubine. She told Atli that she had seen Thjothrek and Guthrun both together. Atli was greatly angered thereby. Then Guthrun said:\n\n1. \"What thy sorrow, Atli, | Buthli's son?\nIs thy heart heavy-laden? | Why laughest thou never?\nIt would better befit | the warrior far\nTo speak with men, | and me to look on.\"\n\n~<Atli spake:~>\n2. \"It troubles me, Guthrun, | Gjuki's daughter,\nWhat Herkja here | in the hall hath told me,\nThat thou in the bed | with Thjothrek liest,\nBeneath the linen | in lovers' guise.\"\n\n~<Guthrun spake:~>\n3. \"This shall I | with oaths now swear,\nSwear by the sacred | stone so white,\nThat nought was there | with Thjothmar's son\nThat man or woman | may not know.\n\n[~<Prose~>. The annotator derived all the material for this note from the poem itself, except for the reference to Herkja as Atli's former concubine. ~<Herkja~>: the historical Kreka and the Helche of the ~<Nibelungenlied~>, who there appears as Etzel's (Attila's) first wife. ~<Thjothrek~>: cf. Introductory Note.\n\n2. The manuscript omits the names of the speakers through out.\n\n3. ~<Holy stone~>: just what this refers to is uncertain; it may be identical with the \"ice-cold stone of Uth\" mentioned in an oath in ~<Helgakvitha Hundingsbana II~>, 29. ~<Thjothmar's son~>: the manuscript has simply \"Thjothmar.\" Some editions change it as]",

				"4. \"Nor ever once | did my arms embrace\nThe hero brave, | the leader of hosts;\nIn another manner | our meeting was,\nWhen our sorrows we | in secret told.\n\n5. \"With thirty warriors | Thjothrek came,\nNor of all his men | doth one remain;\nThou hast murdered my brothers | and mail-clad men,\nThou hast murdered all | the men of my race.\n\n6. \"Gunnar comes not, | Hogni I greet not,\nNo longer I see | my brothers loved;\nMy sorrow would Hogni | avenge with the sword,\nNow myself for my woes | I shall payment win.\n\n7. \"Summon Saxi, | the southrons' king,\nFor be the boiling | kettle can hallow.\"\n\n[here, some assume that Thjothmar is another name or an error for Thjothrek, and Finnur Jonsson not only retains Thjothmar here but changes Thjothrek to Thjothmar in stanza 5 to conform to it.\n\n5. Regarding the death of Thjothrek's men cf. ~<Guthrunarkvitha II~>, introductory prose, note. It was on these stanzas of ~<Guthrunarkvitha III~> that the annotator based his introduction to ~<Guthrunarkvitha II~>. The manuscript repeats the \"thirty\" in line 2, in defiance of metrical requirements.\n\n6. In the manuscript this stanza follows stanza 7; many editions have made the transposition.\n\n7. Who Saxi may be is not clear, but the stanza clearly points to the time when the ordeal by boiling water was still regarded as a foreign institution, and when a southern king (i. e., a Christian from some earlier-converted region) was necessary]",

				"Seven hundred | there were in the hall,\nEre the queen her hand | in the kettle thrust.\n\n8. To the bottom she reached | with hand so bright,\nAnd forth she brought | the flashing stones:\n\"Behold, ye warriors, | well am I cleared\nOf sin by the kettle's | sacred boiling.\"\n\n9. Then Atli's heart | in happiness laughed,\nWhen Guthrun's hand | unhurt he saw;\n\"Now Herkja shall come | the kettle to try,\nShe who grief | for Guthrun planned.\"\n\n10. Ne'er saw man sight | more sad than this,\nHow burned were the hands | of Herkja then;\nIn a bog so foul | the maid they flung,\nAnd so was Guthrun's | grief requited.\n\n[to consecrate the kettle used in the test. The ordeal by boiling water followed closely the introduction of Christianity, which took place around the year 1000. Some editions make two stanzas out of stanza 7, and Müllenhoff contends that lines 1-2 do not constitute part of Guthrun's speech.\n\n10. The word \"requited\" in line 4 is omitted in the manuscript, but it is clear that some such word was intended. The punishment of casting a culprit into a bog to be drowned was particularly reserved for women, and is not infrequently mentioned in the sagas.]"

				"~<Oddrunargratr~>\n\n~<The Lament of Oddrun~>\n\n~<Introductory Note~>\n\nThe ~<Oddrunargratr~> follows ~<Guthrunarkvitha III~> in the ~<Codex Regius~>; it is not quoted or mentioned elsewhere, except that the composer of the \"short\" Sigurth lay seems to have been familiar with it. The ~<Volsungasaga~> says nothing of the story on which it is based, and mentions Oddrun only once, in the course of its paraphrase of Brynhild's prophecy from the \"short\" Sigurth lay. That the poem comes from the eleventh century is generally agreed; prior to the year 1000 there is no trace of the figure of Oddrun, Atli's sister, and yet the ~<Oddrunargratr~> is almost certainly older than the \"short\" Sigurth lay, so that the last half of the eleventh century seems to be a fairly safe guess.\n\nWhere or how the figure of Oddrun entered the Sigurth-Atli cycle is uncertain. She does not appear in any of the extant German versions, and it is generally assumed that she was a creation of the North, though the poet refers to \"old tales\" concerning her. She does not directly affect the course of the story at all, though the poet has used effectively the episode of Gunnar's death, with the implication that Atli's vengeance on Gunnar and Hogni was due, at least in part, to his discovery of Gunnar's love affair with Oddrun. The material which forms the background of Oddrun's story belongs wholly to the German part of the legend (cf. introductory note to ~<Gripisspo~>), and is paralleled with considerable closeness in the ~<Nibelungenlied~>; only Oddrun herself and the subsidiary figures of Borgny and Vilmund are Northern additions. The geography, on the other hand, is so utterly chaotic as to indicate that the original localization of the Atli story had lost all trace of significance by the time this poem was composed.\n\nIn the manuscript the poem, or rather the brief introductory prose note, bears the heading \"Of Borgny and Oddrun,\" but nearly all editions, following late paper manuscripts, have given the poem the title it bears here. Outside of a few apparently defective stanzas, and some confusing transpositions, the Poem has clearly been preserved in good condition, and the beginning and end are definitely marked.",

				"__________________\n\nHeithrek was the name of a king, whose daughter was called Borgny. Vilmund was the name of the man who was her lover. She could not give birth to a child until Oddrun, Atli's sister, had come to her; Oddrun had been beloved of Gunnar, son of Gjuki. About this story is the following poem.\n\n1. I have heard it told | in olden tales\nHow a maiden came | to Morningland;\nNo one of all | on earth above\nTo Heithrek's daughter | help could give.\n\n2. This Oddrun learned, | the sister of Atli,\nThat sore the maiden's | sickness was;\nThe bit-bearer forth | from his stall she brought,\nAnd the saddle laid | on the steed so black.\n\n3. She let the horse go | o'er the level ground,\nTill she reached the hall | that loftily rose,\n\n[~<Prose~>. Nothing further is known of ~<Heithrek~>, ~<Borgny~> or ~<Vilmund~>. The annotator has added the name of Borgny's father, but otherwise his material comes from the poem itself. ~<Oddrun~>, sister of Atli and Brynhild, here appears as proficient in birth runes (cf. ~<Sigrdrifumol~>, 8). Regarding her love for Gunnar, Guthrun's brother, and husband of her sister, Brynhild, cf. ~<Sigurtharkvitha en skamma~>, 57 and note.\n\n1. ~<Olden tales~>: this may be merely a stock phrase, or it may really mean that the poet found his story in oral prose tradition. ~<Morningland~>: the poem's geography is utterly obscure. \"Morningland\" is apparently identical with \"Hunland\" (stanza 4), and yet Oddrun is herself sister of the king of the Huns. Vigfusson tries to make \"Mornaland\" into \"Morva land\" and explain it as Moravia. Probably it means little more than a country lying vaguely in the East. With stanza 28 the confusion grows worse.]",

				"(And in she went | from the end of the hall;)\nFrom the weary steed | the saddle she took;\nHear now the speech | that first she spake:\n\n4. \"What news on earth, |  . . . . .\nOr what has happened | in Hunland now?\"\n\n~<A serving-maid spake:~>\n\"Here Borgny lies | in bitter pain,\nThy friend, and, Oddrun, | thy help would find.\"\n\n~<Oddrun spake:~>\n5. 'Who worked this woe | for the woman thus,\nOr why so sudden | is Borgny sick?\"\n\n~<The serving-maid spake:~>\n\"Vilmund is he, | the heroes' friend,\nWho wrapped the woman | in bedclothes warm,\n(For winters five, | yet her father knew not).\"\n\n6. Then no more | they spake, methinks;\nShe went at the knees | of the woman to sit;\n\n[3. Line 3 (cf. ~<Völundarkvitha~>, 17) or line 5 (cf. ~<Thrymskvitha~>, 2), both quoted from older poems, is probably spurious; the manuscript marks line 3 as the beginning of a new stanza.\n\n4. Line 1 in the original appears to have lost its second half. In line 2 the word rendered \"has happened\" is doubtful. The manuscript does not indicate the speaker of lines 3-4, and a few editors assign them to Borgny herself.\n\n5. The manuscript does not indicate the speakers. ~<For the woman~>: conjectural; the manuscript has instead: \"What warrior now hath worked this woe?\" The manuscript indicates line 3 as beginning a new stanza. Line 5, apparently modeled on line, 4 of stanza n, is probably spurious.]",

Charms: cf. ~<Sigrdrifumol~>, 8.\n\n7. ~<Hogni's slayer~>: obviously Vilmund, but unless he was the one of Atli's followers who actually cut out Hogni's heart (cf. ~<Drap Niflunga~>), there is nothing else to connect him with Hogni's death. Sijmons emends the line to read \"Born of the sister | of Hogni's slayer.\"'\n\n8. Regarding ~<Frigg~> as a goddess of healing cf. ~<Svipdagsmol~>, 52, note. Regarding ~<Freyja~> as the friend of lovers cf. ~<Grimnismol~>, 14, note. A line is very possibly missing from this stanza.\n\n9. The manuscript does not name the speaker. In line 2 the word rendered \"earn\" is omitted in the manuscript, but nearly all editions have supplied it. Line 5 is clearly either interpolated or out of place. It may be all that is left of a stanza which stood between stanzas 15 and 16, or it may belong in stanza 12.]",

The changes made here, following several of the editions, are: (a) the transposition of stanzas 10-11, which are clearly dialogue, out of the body of the lament to a position just before it; (b) the transposition of lines 1-2 of stanza 15 to their present position from the middle of stanza 19.\n\n10.

Apparently Borgny was present at Atli's court while the love affair between Oddrun and Gunnar was in progress, and criticised Oddrun for her part in it. ~<A draught~>, etc.: apparently in reference to a secret meeting of the lovers.\n\n12. In the manuscript this stanza follows stanza 9; cf. note on stanzas 10-20. No gap is indicated, but something has presumably been lost. Grundtvig supplies as a first line: \"The maid her evil days remembered,\" and inserts as a second line line 5 of stanza 9.]",

The manuscript indicates line 3, but not line 1, as the beginning of a new stanza; some editions combine lines 3-4 with lines 3-4 of stanza 15. Making Buthli plan the marriage of Oddrun and Gunnar may be a sheer invention of the poet, or may point to an otherwise lost version of the legend.\n\n15. Lines 1-2 have here been transposed from the middle of stanza 19; cf. note on stanzas 10-20. ~<Wish-maid~>: a Valkyrie, so called because the Valkyries fullfilled Othin's wish in choosing the slain heroes for Valhall. The reference to Brynhild as a Valkyrie by no means fits with the version of the story used in stanzas 16-17, and the poet seems to have attempted to combine the two contradictory traditions, cf. ~<Fafnismol~>, note on stanza 44. In the manuscript stanzas 10-11 follow line 4 of stanza 15.]",

In stanzas 16-17 the underlying story seems to be the one used in ~<Sigurtharkvitha~> ~<en~> ~<skamma~> (particularly stanzas 32-39), and referred to in ~<Guthrunarkvitha I~>, 24, wherein Gunnar and Sigurth lay siege to Atli's city (it here appears as Brynhild's) and are bought off only by Atli's giving Brynhild to Gunnar as wife, winning her consent thereto by falsely representing to her that Gunnar is Sigurth. This version is, of course, utterly at variance with the one in which Sigurth wins Brynhild for Gunnar by riding through the ring of flames, and is probably more closely akin to the early German traditions. In the ~<Nibelungenlied~> Brynhild appears as a queen ruling over lands and peoples. ~<Fafnir's slayer~>: Sigurth.\n\n17. Cf. note on preceding stanza.\n\n19. Cf. ~<Sigurtharkvitha~> ~<en~> ~<skamma~>, stanzas 64-70.\n\n19. In the manuscript lines 1-2 of stanza 15 follow line 2, resulting in various conjectural combinations.

The manuscript marks line 3 as beginning a new stanza, as also in stanzas 21 and 22.\n\n23. ~<Murky wood~>: the forest which divided Atli's realm from that of the Gjukungs is in ~<Atlakvitha~>, 3, called Myrkwood.

Evidently ~<Guthrun~> has already become Atli's wife.\n\n26. If a stanza has been lost after stanza 25, it may well have told of Atli's treacherous invitation to the Gjukungs to visit him; cf. ~<Drap Niflunga~>, which likewise tells of the slaying of ~<Hogni~> and Gunnar (~<the other~>).\n\n27. In the manuscript these three lines follow line 2 of stanza 28. No gap is indicated in the manuscript, In the ~<Volsungasaga~> Guthrun gives her brother the harp, with which he puts the serpents to sleep. The episode is undoubtedly related to the famous thirtieth Aventiure of the ~<Nibelungenlied~>, in which Volker plays the followers of Gunther to sleep before the final battle.]",

In the manuscript the three lines of stanza 27 follow line 2, and line 3 is marked as beginning a new stanza. ~<Geirmund~>: nothing further is known of him, but he seems to be an ally or retainer of Atli, or possibly his brother. ~<Hlesey~>: the poet's geography is here in very bad shape. Hlesey is (or may be) the Danish island of Läsö, in the Kattegat (cf. ~<Harbarthsljoth~>, 37 and note), and thither he has suddenly transported not only Gunnar's death-place but Atli's whole dwelling (cf. stanza 29), despite his previous references to the ride to Hunland (stanzas 3-4) and the \"murky wood\" (stanza 23). Geirmund's home, where Oddrun has gone, is separated from Hlesey and Atli's dwelling by a sound (stanza 29). However, geographical accuracy is seldom to be looked for in heroic epic poetry.\n\n29. Many editions combine this stanza with lines 3-4 of stanza 28. ~<The sound:~> cf. note on stanza 28.\n\n30. The manuscript marks line 3 as beginning a new stanza. ~<Atli's mother~>: the ~<Volsungasaga~> does not follow this version; Gunnar puts all the serpents but one to sleep with his harp playing, \"but a mighty and evil adder crawled to him and drove his fangs into him till they reached his heart, and so he died.\" It is possible that \"Atli\" is a scribal error for a word meaning \"of serpents.\"]",

				"~<Atlakvitha En Grönlenzka~>\n\n~<The Greenland Lay of Atli~>\n\n~<Introductory Note~>\n\nThere are two Atli poems in the ~<Codex Regius~>, the ~<Atlakvitha~> (Lay of Atli) and the ~<Atlamol~> (Ballad of Atli). The poems are not preserved or quoted in any other old manuscript, but they were extensively used by the compilers of the ~<Volsungasaga~>. In the manuscript superscription to each of these poems appears the word \"Greenland,\" which has given rise to a large amount of argument. The scribe was by no means infallible, and in this case his statement proves no more than that in the period round 1300 there was a tradition that these two poems originated in the Greenland settlement.\n\nThe two Atli poems deal with substantially the same material: the visit of the sons of Gjuki to Atli's court, their deaths, and the subsequent revenge of their sister, Guthrun, Atli's wife, on her husband. The shorter of the two, the ~<Atlakvitha~>, tells the story with little elaboration; the ~<Atlamol~>, with about the same narrative basis, adds many details, some of them apparently of the poet's invention, and with a romantic, not to say sentimental, quality quite lacking in the ~<Atlakvitha~>. Both poems are sharply distinguished from the rest of the collection by their metrical form, which is the Malahattr (used irregularly also in the ~<Harbarthsljoth~>), employed consistently and smoothly in the ~<Atlamol~>, and with a considerable mixture of what appear to be Fornyrthislag lines (cf. Introduction) in the ~<Atlakvitha~>.\n\nIt is altogether probable that both poems belong to the eleventh century, the shorter ~<Atlakvitha~> being generally dated from the first quarter thereof, and the longer ~<Atlamol~> some fifty years or more later. In each case the poet was apparently a Christian; in the ~<Atlamol~> (stanza 82) Guthrun expresses her readiness to die and \"go into another light,\" and in the ~<Atlakvitha~> there is frequent use of mythological names (~<e.g.~>, Valhall, Hlithskjolf) with an evident lack of understanding of their relation to the older gods. These facts fit the theory of a Greenland origin exceedingly well, for the Greenland settlement grew rapidly after the first explorations of Eirik the Red, which were in 982-985, and its most flourishing period was in the eleventh century. The internal evidence, particularly in the case of the ~<Atlamol~>, points",

				"likewise to an origin remote from Iceland, Norway, and the \"Western Isles\"; and the two poems are sufficiently alike so that, despite the efforts of Finnur Jonsson and others to separate them, assigning one to Greenland and the other to Norway or else where, it seems probable that the manuscript statement is correct in both instances, and that the two Atli poems did actually originate in Greenland. An interesting account of this Greenland settlement is given in William Hovgaard's ~<Voyages of the Norsemen to America~>, published by the American-Scandinavian Foundation in 1914, and an extraordinarily vivid picture of the sufferings of the early settlers appears in Maurice Hewlett's ~<Thorgils~>, taken from the ~<Floamannasaga~>.\n\nFrom the standpoint of narrative material there is little that is distinctively Norse in either the ~<Atlakvitha~> or the ~<Atlamol~>. The story is the one outlined in the prose ~<Drap Niflunga~> (largely based on these two poems), representing almost exclusively the southern blending of the Attila and Burgundian legends (cf. introductory note to ~<Gripisspo~>). In the ~<Atlakvitha~>, indeed, the word \"Burgundians\" is actually used. Brynhild is not mentioned in either poem; Sigurth's name appears but once, in the ~<Atlamol~>. Thus the material goes directly back to its South-Germanic origins, with little of the Northern making-over which resulted in such extensive changes in most parts of the Sigurth story. The general atmosphere, on the other hand, particularly in the ~<Atlamol~>, is essentially Norse.\n\nAs has been said, the ~<Atlakvitha~> is metrically in a chaotic state, the normal Malahattr lines being frequently interspersed with lines and even stanzas which apparently are of the older Fornyrthislag type. How much of this confusion is due to faulty transmission is uncertain, but it has been suggested that the composer of the ~<Atlakvitha~> made over in Malahattr an older Atli poem in ~<Fornyrthislag~>, and this suggestion has much to recommend it. That he worked on the basis of an older poem is, indeed, almost certain, for in oral prose tradition a far larger number of distinctively Norse traits would unquestionably have crept in than are found in the material of the ~<Atlakvitha~>. As for the ~<Atlamol~>, here again the poet seems to have used an older poem as his basis, possibly the ~<Atlakvitha~> itself, although in that case he must have had other material as well, for there are frequent divergences in such matters as proper names. The translation of the ~<Atlakvitha~> is rendered peculiarly difficult ",

				"by the irregularity of the metre, by the evident faultiness of the transmission, and above all by the exceptionally large number of words found nowhere else in Old Norse, involving much guesswork as to their meanings. The notes do not attempt to indicate all the varying suggestions made by editors and commentators as to the reconstruction of defective stanzas and the probable meanings of obscure passages; in cases which are purely or largely guesswork the notes merely point out the uncertainty without cataloguing the proposed solutions.\n\n__________________\n\nGuthrun, Gjuki's daughter, avenged her brothers, as has become well known. She slew first Atli's sons, and thereafter she slew Atli, and burned the hall with his whole company. Concerning this was the following poem made:\n\n1. Atli sent | of old to Gunnar\nA keen-witted rider, | Knefröth did men call him;\nTo Gjuki's home came he | and to Gunnar's dwelling,\nWith benches round the hearth, | and to the beer so sweet.\n\n[~<Prose~>. On the marriage of Guthrun to Atli at the instigation of her brothers, Gunnar and Hogni, and on the slaying of Atli and his two sons, Erp and Eitil, cf. ~<Drap Niflunga~> and note.\n\n1. Line 1 apparently is in Fornyrthislag. ~<Knefröth~> (the name is spelt in various ways, and its meaning is uncertain): in the ~<Atlamol~> (stanza 4) there are two messengers, one named Vingi and the other unnamed; the annotator combines the two versions in the ~<Drap Niflunga~>. ~<Benches~>, etc.: the adjective rendered \"round the hearth,\" which etymologically it ought to mean, is made obscure by its application to \"helmets\" in stanzas 3 and 17.]",

				"2. Then the followers, hiding | their falseness, all drank\nTheir wine in the war-hall, | of the Huns' wrath wary;\nAnd Knefröth spake loudly, | his words were crafty,\nThe hero from the south, | on the high bench sitting:\n\n3. \"Now Atli has sent me | his errand to ride,\nOn my bit-champing steed | through Myrkwood the secret,\nTo bid You, Gunnar, | to his benches to come,\nWith helms round the hearth, | and Atli's home seek.\n\n4. \"Shields shall ye choose there, | and shafts made of ash-wood,\nGold-adorned helmets, | and slaves out of Hunland,\n\n[2. ~<Falseness~>: i.e., Gunnar's followers concealed their fear and hatred of the Huns at the feast; but the word may mean \"fear of treachery.\" ~<War-hall~>: the word used is \"Valhall,\" the name of Othin's hall of slain warriors.\n\n3. ~<Myrkwood the secret~> (the adjective is literally \"unknown\") the which divided Atli's realm from that of the Gjukungs; cf. ~<Oddrunargratr~>, 23 and note. ~<Around the hearth~>: the adjective is the same one which is applied to \"benches\" in stanza 1 (cf. note); it may be an error here, or it may possibly have the force of \"of your followers,\" i.e., Gunnar is to arm the men of his household (those who are round his hearth) for the journey.\n\n4. ~<Slaves~>, etc.: some editions have \"swords in plenty.\" ~<Scarlet~>: the word apparently means \"slaughter-red,\" \"blood-red,\" but it may mean something entirely different.]",

His head turned Gunnar, | and to Hogni he said:\n\"What thy counsel, young hero, | when such things we hear?\nNo gold do I know | on Gnitaheith lying\nSo fair that other | its equal we have not.\n\n7. \"We have seven halls, | each of swords is full,\n\n[5. ~<Gnitaheith~>: here the dragon Fafnir had his lair (cf. ~<Gripisspo~>, 11). Sigurth doubtless owned it after Fafnir's death, and the Gjukungs after they had killed Sigurth. Possibly they had given it to Atli in recompense for the death of his sister, Brynhild, and he now offered to restore it to them, or--as seems more likely--the poet was not very clear about its ownership himself. ~<Stems~>: i.e., the gilded stems of ships, carved like dragons,--an evident northern touch, if the word is correct, which is by no means certain . ~<Danp~>: this name was early applied to a mythical Danish king (cf. ~<Rigsthula~>, 49 and note) but it may have been fabricated by error out of the word \"DanparstaÞir\" (the phrase here used is \"staÞi Danpar\"), used in the ~<Hervararsaga~> of a field of battle between the Goths and the Huns, and quite possibly referring to the region of the Dnieper. The name seems to have clung to the Atli tradition long after it had lost all definite significance. ~<Myrkwood~>: cf. note on stanza 3.]",

				"(And all of gold | is the hilt of each;)\nMy steed is the swiftest, | my sword is sharpest,\nMy bows adorn benches, | my byrnies are golden,\nMy helm is the brightest | that came from Kjar's hall,\n(Mine own is better | than all the Huns' treasure.)\"\n\n~<Hogni spake:~>\n8. \"What seeks she to say, | that she sends us a ring,\nWoven with a wolf's hair? | methinks it gives warning;\nIn the red ring a hair | of the heath-dweller found I,\nWolf-like shall our road be | if we ride on this journey.\"\n\n9. Not eager were his comrades, | nor the men of his kin,\n\n[7. The stanza is clearly in bad shape; the manuscript indicates line 5 as beginning a new stanza. In line 5 the manuscript has \"and shield\" after \"helm.\" ~<Kjar~>: Gering ingeniously identifies this Kjar with Kjar the father of Olrun, mentioned in the ~<Völundarkvitha~>, introductory prose and stanza 2, on the basis of a genealogy in the ~<Flateyjarbok~>, in which Authi, the grand father of Kjar (by no means certainly the same man) and Buthli, father of Atli, are mentioned as making a raiding voyage together. This identification, however, rests on slight evidence.\n\n8. The manuscript does not name the speaker. One editor gives the first sentence to Gunnar. ~<She~>, etc.: Guthrun, seeking to warn her brothers of Atli's treachery, sends them a ring with a wolf's hair as a sign of danger; in the ~<Atlamol~> (stanza 4) she sends a message written in runes; cf. ~<Drap Niflunga~>. ~<Heath-dweller~>: wolf.]",

				"The wise nor the wary, | nor the warriors bold.\nBut Gunnar spake forth | as befitted a king,\nNoble in the beer-hall, | and bitter his scorn:\n\n10. \"Stand forth now, Fjornir! | and hither on the floor\nThe beakers all golden | shalt thou bring to the warriors.\n. . . . .  . . . . .\n. . . . .  . . . . .\n\n11. \"The wolves then shall rule | the wealth of the Niflungs,\nWolves aged and grey-hued, | if Gunnar is lost,\nAnd black-coated bears | with rending teeth bite,\nAnd make glad the dogs, | if Gunnar returns not.\"\n\n[9. In line 1 the manuscript has \"His comrades did not urge Gunnar,\" but the name, involving a metrical error, seems to have been inserted through a scribal blunder.\n\n10. The manuscript indicates no lacuna, but probably two lines have dropped out, for the ~<Volsungasaga~> paraphrase runs: \"Give us to drink in great cups, for it may well be that this shall be our last feast.\" ~<Fjornir~>: Gunnar's cup-bearer.\n\n11. Bugge thinks this stanza is spoken by Gunnar's terrified followers; Grundtvig assigns it to Hogni. Apparently, however, Gunnar means that if he and his men are not valiant enough to make the journey and return safely, it matters little what may happen to them. ~<Niflungs~>: regarding the application of this name to Gunnar's Burgundians cf. ~<Brot~>, 17 and note. ~<Bears~>: these \"black\" bears have been used as arguments against the Greenland origin of the poem. ~<And make glad the dogs~>: i.e., by giving them corpses to eat, but the phrase in the original is more than doubtful.]",

A following gallant | fared forth with the ruler,\nYet they wept as their home | with the hero they left;\nAnd the little heir | of Hogni called loudly:\n\"Go safe now, ye wise ones, | wherever ye will!\"\n\n13.

Some editions in line 2 read \"home of the Niflungs\" instead of \"their home,\" and others \"home of the Huns,\" the manuscript reading being \"home of the men.\" ~<Heir~>: the ~<Atlamol~> (stanza 28) names two sons of Hogni, Snævar and Solar, both of whom make the journey with their father and are killed. The ~<Volsungasaga~>, combining the two versions, says that Snævar and Solar went with their father, and implies that it was a third and still younger son who said: \"Farewell, and have a good time\" (thus literally).\n\n11. ~<Myrkwood~>: cf. stanza 3 and note; the journey is here made by land, whereas in the ~<Atlamol~> it is made partly by boat; cf. ~<Atlamol~>, 34 and note. ~<Whip-fearers~>: horses, but there is some uncertainty as to the word.\n\n13. In line 1 the manuscript has \"land\" instead of \"halls,\" which involves a metrical error. ~<Watch-towers~>: the word used is identical with the name of Othin's watch-tower, Hlithskjolf (cf. ~<Grimnismol~>, introductory prose). ~<Buthli~>: the manuscript has \"Bikki,\" which has led some editors to transfer this stanza to]",

Line 4 is apparently in Fornyrthislag.\n\n15. Line 1 in the manuscript is apparently incorrectly copied, and some editions omit \"Mid weapons and lances\" and assume a gap in either line 1 or line 3.\n\n17. This may be the remains of two stanzas, the manuscript marks line 5 as beginning a new stanza. Editorial conjectures are]",

Some editions insert a conjectural line after line 3. ~<Sword-norns~>, etc.: the line is exceedingly obscure, and the phrase rendered \"sword-norns\" may mean \"corpse-norns.\" Apparently it refers to the warrior-women of the Huns, the \"shield-maids\" of line 5 and of stanza 45. Roman writers refer to the warrior-women among the early Germanic tribes, and the tradition, closely allied to that of the Valkyries, attached itself readily to the ferocious Huns. ~<Den of snakes~>: concerning the manner of Gunnar's death cf. ~<Drap Niflunga~>.\n\n18. The manuscript indicates no lacuna and does not name the speaker; perhaps a line similar to line 1 of stanza 24 (or 26) should be inserted here. ~<Rhine~>: Gunnar's Burgundian home is here clearly localized. After this stanza it is probable that a passage describing the battle has been lost.\n\n19. These two lines, apparently the remains of a full stanza,]",

This is the only place in the poems in which the name \"Burgundian\" appears; that the poet had no very clear conception of its meaning is indicated by the fact that in stanza 21 he calls Gunnar \"king of the Goths.\"\n\n20. Apparently a Fornyrthislag stanza, though most editions have attempted to expand the lines into Malahattr. The exploits of Hogni (Hagene), with the names of many of his victims, are told in the ~<Nibelungenlied~>. ~<The fire~>: in the Nibelungenlied Kriemhild has the hall set on fire, and the Burgundians fight amid the flames. Line 4 is clearly defective, and some editors regard the name \"Gunnar\" as all that is left of the first two lines of stanza 21.\n\n21. Again apparently the remains of a Fornyrthislag stanza. Editors have attempted various combinations of the lines. ~<Gold~>: presumably Sigurth's treasure.\n\n22.

He did not, of course, intend that the heart should be cut from the living Hogni.\n\n23. Most editions assume a gap (lines 1-2, 2-3 or 3-4). ~<Hjalli~>: Atli's cook, killed to deceive Gunnar, as Atli hoped to wring the secret of the hoard from Hogni if Gunnar remained silent. In the ~<Atlamol~> (stanzas 59-60) Atli's men prepare to kill Hjalli, but he is spared at Hogni's intercession.\n\n25. ~<Helm-hammerer~> (literally \"helmet-smith\"): warrior, i.e., Hogni.

Apparently all that is left of a full stanza. The manuscript does not name Atli as the speaker, and Grundtvig inserts: \"Then Atli called, | the king of the Huns,\" as a first line. Some editors combine this line with the two lines of stanza 33. ~<Wagon~>: in ~<Brot~>, 16, Gunnar is led to his death in the serpents' den on horseback, not in a wagon.\n\n31. The stanza in the original is hopelessly confused. ~<Glaum~>: this horse of Atli's is mentioned by name elsewhere. ~<Long-maned~>: uncertain. The manuscript indicates no gap, but something has evidently been lost. ~<Gods of slaughter~>: perhaps the phrase, usually applied to Othin and the other gods, is here used simply to mean \"heroes,\" i.e., Atli, Gunnar, and Hogni. Line 4 suggests Guthrun's tearlessness after Sigurth's death (cf. ~<Guthrunarkvitha II~>, 11)]",

Line 5 is either interpolated or all that is left of a separate stanza.\n\n41. The text of the whole stanza has required a considerable amount of emendation.

Line 1 appears to be in Fornyrthislag. Guthrun distributes Atli's treasures among his followers apparently to prevent their wrath at the slaying of Erp and Eitil from turning against her; Atli, as stanza 43 shows, is too drunk to realize or prevent what she is doing.\n\n43. The second half of line 4 is apparently an error, but none of the editorial suggestions have improved it.\n\n44. Guthrun allows the dogs and the house-thralls, who had no part in Gunnar's death, to escape before she burns the dwelling]",

				"With her death-dealing hand, | and the hounds she loosed,\nThe thralls she awakened, | and a firebrand threw\nIn the door of the hall; | so vengeance she had.\n\n45. To the flames she gave all | who yet were within,\nAnd from Myrkheim had come | from the murder of Gunnar;\nThe timbers old fell, | the temple was in flames,\nThe dwelling of the Buthlungs, | and the shield-maids burned,\nThey were slain in the house, | in the hot flames they sank.\n\n46.

In ~<Atlamol~>, stanzas 83-84, Atli is slain by a son of Hogni (Hniflung?) with Guthrun's help.\n\n45. Some editions transfer line 2 to stanza 37; others reject line 3 as interpolated. ~<Myrkheim~> (\"Dark-Home\"): probably identical with Myrkwood; cf. stanza 3. ~<Temple~>: probably both here and in stanza 42 the word means little more than the place where Atli's treasures were kept; the poet was by no means literal in his use of terms connected with the heathen religion. ~<Buthlungs~>: sons of Buthli, i.e., Atli and his family. ~<Shield-maids~>: cf. stanza 17 and note.\n\n46. The entire stanza is very likely a later addition. ~<Three kings~>: Atli and his two sons, Erp and Eitil.]"

				"~<Atlamol En Grönlenzku~>\n\n~<The Greenland Ballad of Atli~>\n\n~<Introductory Note~>\n\nMany of the chief facts regarding the ~<Atlamol~>, which follows the ~<Atlakvitha~> in the ~<Codex~> ~<Regius~>, are outlined in the introductory note to the earlier Atli lay. That the superscription in the manuscript is correct, and that the poem was actually composed in Greenland, is generally accepted; the specific reference to polar bears (stanza 17), and the general color of the entire poem make this origin exceedingly likely. Most critics, again, agree in dating the poem nearer 1100 than 1050. As to its state of preservation there is some dispute, but, barring one or two possible gaps of some importance, and the usual number of passages in which the interpolation or omission of one or two lines may be suspected, the ~<Atlamol~> has clearly come down to us in fairly good shape.\n\nThroughout the poem the epic quality of the story itself is overshadowed by the romantically sentimental tendencies of the poet, and by his desire to adapt the narrative to the understanding of his fellow-Greenlanders. The substance of the poem is the same as that of the ~<Atlakvitha~>; it tells of Atli's message to the sons of Gjuki, their journey to Atli's home, the slaying of Hogni and Gunnar, Guthrun's bitterness over the death of her brothers, and her bloody revenge on Atli. Thus in its bare out line the ~<Atlamol~> represents simply the Frankish blending of the legends of the slaughter of the Burgundians and the death of Attila (cf. ~<Gripisspo~>, introductory note). But here the resemblance ends. The poet has added characters, apparently of his own creation, for the sake of episodes which would appeal to both the men and the women of the Greenland settlement. Sea voyages take the place of journeys by land; Atli is reproached, not for cowardice in battle, but for weakness at the Thing or great council. The additions made by the poet are responsible for the ~<Atlamol's~> being the longest of all the heroic poems in the Eddic collection, and they give it a kind of emotional vivid ness, but it has little of the compressed intensity of the older poems. Its greatest interest lies in its demonstration of the manner in which a story brought to the North from the South Germanic lands could be adapted to the understanding and tastes of its",

				"eleventh century hearers without any material change of the basic narrative.\n\nIn what form or forms the story of the Gjukungs and Atli reached the Greenland poet cannot be determined, but it seems likely that he was familiar with older poems on the subject, and possibly with the ~<Atlakvitha~> itself. That the details which are peculiar to the ~<Atlamol~>, such as the figures of Kostbera and Glaumvor, existed in earlier tradition seems doubtful, but the son of Hogni, who aids Guthrun in the slaying of Atli, appears, though under another name, in other late versions of the story, and it is impossible to say just how much the poet relied on his own imagination and how far he found suggestions and hints in the prose or verse stories of Atli with which he was familiar.\n\nThe poem is in Malahattr (cf. Introduction) throughout, the verse being far more regular than in the ~<Atlakvitha~>. The compilers of the ~<Volsungasaga~> evidently knew it in very much the form in which we now have it, for in the main it is paraphrased with great fidelity.\n\n1. There are many who know | how of old did men\nIn counsel gather; | little good did they get;\nIn secret they plotted, | it was sore for them later,\nAnd for Gjuki's sons, | whose trust they deceived.\n\n2. Fate grew for the princes, | to death they were given;\nIll counsel was Atli's, | though keenness he had;\n\n[1. ~<Men~>: Atli and his advisers, with whom he planned the death of the sons of ~<Gjuki~>, Gunnar and Hogni. The poet's reference to the story as well known explains the abruptness of his introduction, without the mention of Atli's name, and his reference to Guthrun in stanza 3 simply as \"the woman\" (\"husfreyja,\" goddess of the house).\n\n2. ~<Princes~>: Atli, Gunnar, and Hogni. ~<Bulwark~>: Atli's slaying]",

				"He felled his staunch bulwark, | his own sorrow fashioned,\nSoon a message he sent | that his kinsmen should seek him.\n\n3. Wise was the woman, | she fain would use wisdom,\nShe saw well what meant | all they said in secret;\nFrom her heart it was hid | how help she might render,\nThe sea they should sail, | while herself she should go not.\n\n4. Runes did she fashion, | but false Vingi made them,\nThe speeder of hatred, | ere to give them he sought;\nThen soon fared the warriors | whom Atli had sent,\nAnd to Limafjord came, | to the home of the kings.\n\n5. They were kindly with ale, | and fires they kindled,\n\n[of his wife's brothers, who were ready to support and defend him in his greatness, was the cause of his own death.\n\n3. ~<The woman~>: Guthrun, concerning whose marriage to Atli cf. ~<Guthrunarkvitha II.~> ~<The sea~>: a late and essentially Greenland variation of the geography of the Atli story. Even the ~<Atlakvitha~>, perhaps half a century earlier, separates Atli's land from that of the Gjukungs only by a forest.\n\n4. ~<Runes~>: on the two versions of Guthrun's warning, and also on the name of the messenger (here Vingi), cf. ~<Drap Niflunga~> and note. ~<Limafjord~>: probably the Limfjord of northern Jutland, an important point in the wars of the eleventh century. The name was derived from \"Eylimafjorþ,\" i.e., Eylimi's fjord. The poet may really have thought that the kingdom of the Burgundians was in Jutland, or he may simply have taken a well-known name for the sake of vividness.]",

				"They thought not of craft | from the guests who had come;\nThe gifts did they take | that the noble one gave them,\nOn the pillars they hung them, | no fear did they harbor.\n\n6. Forth did Kostbera, | wife of Hogni, then come,\nFull kindly she was, | and she welcomed them both;\nAnd glad too was Glaumvor, | the wife of Gunnar,\nShe knew well to care | for the needs of the guests.\n\n7. Then Hogni they asked | if more eager he were,\nFull clear was the guile, | if on guard they had been;\nThen Gunnar made promise, | if Hogni would go,\nAnd Hogni made answer | as the other counseled.\n\n8. Then the famed ones brought mead, | and fair was the feast,\n\n[5. Some editors assume a gap after this stanza.\n\n6. Some editions place this stanza between stanzas 7 and 8. ~<Kostbera~> (\"The Giver of Food\") and ~<Glaumvor~> (\"The Merry\"): presumably creations of the poet. ~<Both~>: Atli's two emissaries, Vingi and the one here unnamed (Knefröth?).\n\n7. It is altogether probable that a stanza has been lost between stanzas 6 and 7, in which Gunnar is first invited, and replies doubtfully. ~<Made promise~>: many editions emend the text to read \"promised the journey.\" The text of line 4 is obscure; the manuscript reads \"nitti\" (\"refused\"), which many editors have changed to \"hlitti,\" which means exactly the opposite. 8. No gap is indicated in the manuscript; Bugge adds (line]",

Others suggest the loss of a line after line 4.\n\n9. The manuscript does not indicate line 1 as the beginning of a stanza; cf. note on stanza 8.\n\n10. Some editions combine this stanza with lines 1-2 of stanza 11. The manuscript indicates no gap. Grundtvig adds (line 2) \"But sleep to the woman | so wise came little.\"\n\n11. Some editions make a separate stanza out of lines 1-2, or combine them with stanza 10, and combine lines 3-4 with stanza]",

The manuscript marks line 3 as beginning a new stanza.\n\n12. Line 5 may be spurious, or else all that is left of a lost stanza. The manuscript marks it as the beginning of a new stanza, which, as the text stands, is clearly impossible.\n\n13. The manuscript, followed by some editions, has \"Hogni spake\" in the middle of line 1. ~<Ill~>: the manuscript and many editions have \"this.\" ~<The king~>: Atli.\n\n14. The manuscript does not indicate the speakers in this dialogue between Kostbera and Hogni (stanzas 14-19). Two line, may possibly have been lost after line 2, filling out stanza 14 and]",

The manuscript marks line 3 as beginning a new stanza. In any case, the lost lines cannot materially have altered the meaning.\n\n15. ~<Saw I~>: the manuscript here, as also in stanzas 16, 18, 2r, 22, and 24, has \"methought,\" which involves a metrical error. Some editors regard lines 3-4 as the remains of a four-line stanza. Regarding Kostbera's warning dreams, and Hogni's matter-of-fact interpretations of them, cf. ~<Guthrunarkvitha II~>, 39-44.\n\n16. The meaning of the first half of line 3 in the original is obscure.]",

Two lines may have been lost after line 2, but the ~<Volsungasaga~> paraphrase gives no clue. ~<Ice-bear~>: polar bears, common in Greenland, are very rarely found in Iceland, and never in Norway, a fact which substantiates the manuscript's reference to Greenland as the home of the poem.\n\n18. The manuscript indicates no gap, but most editors assume the loss of a line after line 1 or 2; Grundtvig adds, after line 1: \"Black were his feathers, | with blood was he covered.\" ~<Atli's spirit~>: the poet's folk-lore seems here a bit weak. Presumably he means such a female following-spirit (\"fylgja\") as appears in ~<Helgakvitha Hjorvarthssonar~>, prose following stanza 34 (cf. note thereon), but the word he uses, \"hamr\" (masculine) means \"skin,\" \"shape.\" He may, however, imply that Atli had assumed the shape of an eagle for this occasion.\n\n19. The manuscript indicates line 4 as beginning a new stanza.]",

				"True is Atli's heart, | whatever thou dreamest.\"\nThen silent they were, | and nought further they said.\n\n20.

The manuscript indicates no gap, but none of the many attempted emendations have made sense out of the words as they stand. The proper location for' the missing words is sheer guesswork. ~<Two roads~>: probably the meaning is that their way (i.e., their success) would be doubtful.\n\n21. The manuscript does not indicate the speakers in this dialogue (stanzas 21-26). No gap is indicated after line 2. Most editors assume the loss of two lines or of a full stanza after]",

				"Such a dream is hard | o a husband to tell,--\nA spear stood, methought, | through thy body thrust,\nAnd at head and feet | the wolves were howling.\"\n\n~<Gunnar spake:~>\n23. \"The hounds are running, | loud their barking is heard,\nOft hounds' clamor follows | the flying of spears.\"\n\n~<Glaumvor spake:~>\n24. \"A river the length | of the hall saw I run,\nFull swiftly it roared, | o'er the benches it swept;\nO'er the feet did it break | of ye brothers twain,\nThe water would yield not; | some meaning there was.\"\n\n* * * * * *\n\n25. \"I dreamed that by night | came dead women hither,\n\n[stanza 21 giving Gunnar's interpretation of Glaumvor's dream, but the ~<Volsungasaga~> gives no clue, as it does not mention this first dream at all. Grundtvig suggests as Gunnar's answer: \"Banners are gleaming, | since of gallows didst dream, / And wealth it must mean | that thou serpents didst watch.\" ~<Gods' doom~>: an odd, and apparently mistaken, use of the phrase \"ragna rök\" (cf. ~<Voluspo~>, introductory note).\n\n25. Perhaps two lines have been lost after line 2. Possibly the concluding phrase of line 2 should be \"bloody spears,\" as in the ~<Volsungasaga~> paraphrase.\n\n24. Again Gunnar's interpretation is missing, and most editors either assume a gap or construct two Malahattr lines (out of the ~<Volsungasaga~> prose paraphrase, which runs: \"The grain shall]",

Possibly a line has been lost from this stanza.\n\n27. ~<Five~>: Gunnar, Hogni, and the three mentioned in Stanza 28.\n\n28.

Full stoutly they rowed, | and the keel clove asunder,\nTheir backs strained at the oars, | and their strength was fierce;\n\n[proper names was not infrequently omitted; cf. Hild for Brynhild (~<Helreith Brynhildar~>, 6). The manuscript indicates no gap; Grundtvig inserts (line 2): \"And clear was her cry to her kinsmen dear.\"\n\n32. Hogni's method of cheering his wife and sister-in-law is somewhat unusual, for the meaning of lines 3-4 is that good wishes and blessings are of little use in warding off danger.\n\n33. Perhaps two lines have been lost after line 2; Grundtvig supplies: \"Then weeping did | Glaumvor go to her rest-bed, / And sadly did Bera | her spinning wheel seek.\"\n\n34. ~<Keel~>, etc.: in the ~<Nibelungenlied~>, and presumably in the older German tradition, Hagene breaks his oar steering the Burgundians across the Danube (stanza 1564), and, after all have landed, splinters the boat (stanza 1581) in order that there may be no retreating. The poet here seems to have confused the story,]",

				"The oar-loops were burst, | the thole-pins, were broken,\nNor the ship made they fast | ere from her they fared.\n\n35. Not long was it after-- | the end must I tell--\nThat the home they beheld | that Buthli once had;\nLoud the gates resounded | when Hogni smote them;\nVingi spake then a word | that were better unsaid:\n\n36. \"Go ye far from the house, | for false is its entrance,\nSoon shall I burn you, | ye are swiftly smitten;\nI bade ye come fairly, | but falseness was under,\nNow bide ye afar | while your gallows I fashion.\"\n\n37. Then Hogni made answer, | his heart yielded little,\n\n[connecting the breaking of the ship's keel with the violence of the rowing, but echoing the older legend in the last line, wherein the ship is allowed to drift away after the, travellers have landed. ~<Oar-loops~>: the thongs by which the oars in a Norse boat were made fast to the ~<thole-pins~>, the combination taking the place of the modern oarlock.\n\n35. The manuscript indicates line 4 as beginning a new stanza, and many editions combine it with stanza 36, some of them assuming the loss of a line from stanza 35. In the ~<Volsungasaga~> paraphrase the second half of line 4 is made a part of Vingi's speech: \"Better had ye left this undone.\"\n\n36. Cf. note on preceding stanza; the manuscript does not indicate line I as beginning a stanza. Line 3 may be spurious.\n\n37. In the ~<Volsungasaga~> paraphrase the second half of line 1 and the first half of line 2 are included in Hogni's speech.]",

				"And nought did he fear | that his fate held in store:\n\"Seek not to affright us, | thou shalt seldom succeed;\nIf thy words are more, | then the worse grows thy fate.\"\n\n38. Then Vingi did they smite, | and they sent him to hell,\nWith their axes they clove him | while the death rattle came.\n\n39. Atli summoned his men, | in mail-coats they hastened,\nAll ready they came, | and between was the courtyard.\n\n* * * * * *\n\n40. Then came they to words, | and full wrathful they were:\n\n[38. Possibly two lines have been lost after line 2.\n\n39. It is probable that a considerable passage has been lost between stanzas 39 and 40, for the ~<Volsungasaga~> paraphrase includes a dialogue at this point. The manuscript indicates no gap, and most editions combine stanzas 39 and 40 as a single stanza. The prose passage, indicating the substance of what, if any thing, is lost, runs as follows: \"'Be welcome among us, and give me that store of gold which is ours by right, the gold that Sigurth had, and that now belongs to Guthrun.' Gunnar said: 'Never shalt thou get that gold, and men of might shalt thou find here, ere we give up our lives, if it is battle thou dost offer us; in truth it seems that thou hast prepared this feast in kingly fashion,]",

				"\"Long since did we plan | how soon we might slay you.\"\n\n~<Hogni spake:~>\n41. \"Little it matters | if long ye have planned it;\nFor unarmed do ye wait, | and one have we felled,\nWe smote him to hell, | of your host was he once.\"\n\n42. Then wild was their anger | when all heard his words;\nTheir fingers were swift | on their bowstrings to seize,\nFull sharply they shot, | by their shields were they guarded.\n\n43. In the house came the word | how the heroes with out\n\n[and with little grudging toward eagle and wolf.\"' The demand for the treasure likewise appears in the Nibelungenlied.\n\n40. These two lines, which most editions combine with stanza 39, may be the first or last two of a four-line stanza. The ~<Volsungasaga~> gives Atli's speech very much as it appears here.\n\n41. The manuscript does not indicate the speaker; Grundtvig adds as a first line: \"Then Hogni laughed loud where the slain Vingi lay.\" Many editors assume the loss of a line somewhere in the stanza. ~<Unarmed~>: Hogni does not see Atli's armed followers, who are on the other side of the courtyard (stanza 39). One: Vingi.\n\n42. Most editors assume the loss of one line, after either line 1 or line 3.\n\n45. The manuscript reading of lines 1-2, involving a metrical error, is: \"In the house came the word | of the warring without, / Loud in front of the hall | they heard a thrall shouting.\" Some editors assume a gap of two lines after line]",

				"Fought in front of the hall; | they heard a thrall tell it;\nGrim then was Guthrun, | the grief when she heard,\nWith necklaces fair, | and she flung them all from her,\n(The silver she hurled | so the rings burst asunder.)\n\n44. Then out did she go, | she flung open the doors,\nAll fearless she went, | and the guests did she welcome;\nTo the Niflungs she went-- | her last greeting it was,--\nIn her speech truth was clear, | and much would she speak.\n\n45. \"For your safety I sought | that at home ye should stay;\nNone escapes his fate, | so ye hither must fare.\"\nFull wisely she spake, | if yet peace they might win,\n\n[2, the missing passage giving the words of the thrall. The manuscript marks line 3 as the beginning of a stanza, and many editions make a separate stanza of lines 3-5, same of them assuming the loss of a line after line 3. With the stanza as here given, line 5 may well be spurious.\n\n44. ~<Niflungs~>: regarding the application of this term to the Burgundians cf. ~<Atlakvitha~>, 11, and ~<Brot~>, 17, and notes. The manuscript here spells the name with an initial N, as elsewhere, but in stanza 83 the son of Hogni appears with the name \"Hniflung.\" In consequence, some editors change the form in this stanza to \"Hniflungs,\" while others omit the initial H in both cases. I have followed the manuscript, though admittedly its spelling is illogical.]",

				"But to nought would they hearken, | and \"No\" said they all.\n\n46. Then the high-born one saw | that hard was their battle,\nIn fierceness of heart | she flung off her mantle;\nHer naked sword grasped she | her kin's lives to guard,\nNot gentle her hands | in the hewing of battle.\n\n47. Then the daughter of Gjuki | two warriors smote down,\nAtli's brother she slew, | and forth then they bore him;\n(So fiercely she fought | that his feet she clove off;)\nAnother she smote | so that never he stood,\nTo hell did she send him,-- | her hands trembled never.\n\n[46. The warlike deeds of Guthrun represent an odd transformation of the German tradition. Kriemhild, although she did no actual fighting in the ~<Nibelungenlied~>, was famed from early times for her cruelty and fierceness of heart, and this seems to have inspired the poet of the ~<Atlamol~> to make his Guthrun into a warrior outdoing Brynhild herself. Kriemhild's ferocity of course, was directed against Gunther and especially Hagene, for whose slaying she rather than Etzel was responsible; here, on the other hand, Guthrun's is devoted to the defense of her brothers.\n\n47. Line 3 is very likely an interpolation. The manuscript marks line 4 as the beginning of a new stanza, and some editions make a separate stanza of lines 4-5. ~<Atli's brother~>: doubtless a reminiscence of the early tradition represented in the ~<Nibelungenlied~> by the slaying of Etzel's brother, Blœdelin (the historical Bleda), by Dancwart.]",

Then the warrior spake, | and wild was his anger:\n\"This is evil to see, | and thy doing is all;\n\n[48. Line 3 may well be spurious, for it implies that Gunnar and Hogni were killed in battle, whereas they were taken prisoners. Some editors, in an effort to smooth out the inconsistency, change \"themselves\" in this line to \"sound.\" Line 5 has also been questioned as possibly interpolated. ~<Niflungs~>: on the spelling of this name in the manuscript and the various editions cf. note on stanza 44.\n\n49. Line 2 is probably an interpolation, and the original apparently lacks a word. There is some obscurity as to the exact meaning of lines 4-5. ~<The two sons of Bera~>: Snævar and Solar; ~<her brother~> is Orkning; cf. stanza 28.\n\n50. ~<The warrior~>: Atli. ~<Thirty~>: perhaps an echo of the \"thirty warriors\" of Thjothrek (cf. ~<Guthrunarkvitha III~>, 5).

We lay seldom together | since to me thou wast given,\nNow my kin all are gone, | of my gold am I robbed;\nNay, and worst, thou didst send | my sister to hell.\"\n\n[38), we have eleven left, as Atli says, but this does not allow much for the exploits of Gunnar and Hogni, who, by this reckoning, seem to have killed nobody. The explanation probably is that lines 4-5 of stanza 49 are in bad shape.\n\n51. ~<Five brothers~>: the ~<Volsungasaga~> speaks of four (not five) sons of Buthli, but names only Atli. Regarding the death of the first two brothers cf. stanza 91 and note. The manuscript marks line 3 as beginning a stanza, and many editions combine lines 3-4 with stanza 52. Some insert lines 2-3 of stanza 52 ahead of lines 3-4 of stanza 51.\n\n52. Possibly a line has been lost from this stanza. The manuscript marks line 3 as beginning a new stanza, which is impossible unless something has been lost. ~<Gold~>: the meaning of this half line is somewhat doubtful, but apparently Atli refers to Sigurth's treasure, which should have been his as Brynhild's brother. ~<Sister~>: Brynhild; regarding Guthrun's indirect responsibility for Brynhild's death cf. ~<Gripisspo~>, 45 and note.]",

The manuscript does not name the speaker. ~<The Volsungasaga~> gives the speech, in somewhat altered form, to Hogni. \"Why speakest thou so? Thou wast the first to break peace; thou didst take my kinswoman and starved her in a prison, and murdered her and took her wealth; that was not kinglike; and laughable does it seem to me that thou talkest of thy sorrow, and good shall I find it that all goes ill with thee.\" This presumably represents the correct form of the stanza, for nowhere else is it intimated that Atli killed Guthrun's mother, Grimhild, nor is the niece elsewhere mentioned. Some editions make a separate stanza of lines 4-5, Grundtvig adding a line after line 3 and two more after line 5. Other editors are doubtful about the authenticity of either line 3 or line 5.\n\n54. The manuscript does not indicate the speaker.]",

Afraid was the pot-watcher, | he fled here and yon,\nAnd crazed with his terror | he climbed in the corners:\n\n[56. The text of the first half of line 3 is somewhat uncertain, but the general meaning of it is clear enough.\n\n57. Beiti: not elsewhere mentioned. The ~<Atlakvitha~> version of this episode (stanzas 23-25) does not mention Beiti, and in the ~<Volsungasaga~> the advice to cut out Hjalli's heart instead of Hogni's is given by an unnamed \"counsellor of Atli.\" In the ~<Atlakvitha~> Hjalli is actually killed; the ~<Volsungasaga~> combines the two versions by having Hjalli first let off at Hogni's intercession and then seized a second time and killed, thus introducing the ~<Atlakvitha~> episode of the quaking heart (stanza 24). The text of the first half of line 3 is obscure, and there are many and widely varying suggestions as to the word here rendered \"sluggard.\"\n\n58. Some editions mark line 5 as probably interpolated.]",

Then the brave one they seized; | to the warriors bold\nNo chance was there left | to delay his fate longer;\nLoud did Hogni laugh, | all the sons of day heard him,\n\n[59. ~<Cook~>: the original word is doubtful. The ~<Volsungasaga~> does not paraphrase lines 3-5; the passage may be a later addition, and line 5 is almost certainly so.\n\n61. It is probable that a stanza describing the casting of Gunnar into the serpents' den has been lost after this stanza. ~<Sons of day~>: the phrase means no more than \"men.\"]",

There is some doubt as to the exact meaning of line 2. After this line two lines may have! been lost; Grundtvig adds: \"Few braver shall ever | be found on the earth, / Or loftier men | in the world ever give.\"\n\n64. ~<Wise one~>: Guthrun.

The manuscript does not indicate the speaker. ~<Requital~>, etc.: it is not clear just to what Guthrun refers; perhaps she is thinking of Sigurth's death, or possibly the poet had in mind his reference to the slaying of her mother in stanza 53.]",

Line 5 is very probably a later addition, though some editors question line 3 instead.\n\n69. Guthrun suddenly changes her tone in order to make Atli believe that she is submissive to his will, and thus to gain time for her vengeance. Line 2 in the original is thoroughly obscure; it runs literally: \"On the knee goes the fist if the twigs are taken off.\" Perhaps the word meaning \"fist\" may also have meant \"tree-top,\" as Gering suggests, or perhaps the line is an illogical blending of the ideas contained in lines 1 and 3.\n\n70. The manuscript indicates line 3 as the beginning of a new stanza, ~<Two shields~>, etc.: i. e., Guthrun concealed her hostility (symbolized by a red shield, cf. ~<Helgakvitha Hundingsbana~> I, 34) by a show of friendliness (a white shield).]",

The manuscript marks line 3 as beginning a new stanza; some editions make a separate stanza of lines 3-5, while others combine them with lines 1-2 of stanza 73. Line 2 in the original is clearly defective, the verb being omitted. The meaning of line 3 is uncertain; the ~<Volsungasaga~> paraphrase has: \"At evening she took the sons of King Atli (Erp and Eitil) where they were playing with a block of wood.\" Probably the text of the line as we have it is faulty.

The manuscript indicates no gap (lines 1-2), and most editions make a single line, despite the defective meter: \"Thy sons hast thou lost | as thou never shouldst lose them.\" The second part of line 2 is in the original identical with the second half of line 3 of stanza 80, and may perhaps have been inserted here by mistake. ~<Skulls~>: it is possible that line 3 was borrowed from a poem belonging to the Völund tradition (cf. ~<Völundarkvitha~>, 25 and 37), and the idea doubtless came from some such source, but probably the poet inserted it in a line of his own composition to give an added touch of horror.

The manuscript marks line 4 as the beginning of a new stanza. ~<The land~>, etc.: there is much obscurity as to the significance of this line. Some editors omit or question \"me,\" in which case Atli is apparently reproaching Guthrun for having incited him to fight with his brothers to win for himself the whole of Buthli's land. In stanza 91 Guthrun denies that she was to blame for Atli's quarrels with his brothers. The ~<Volsungasaga~> reading supports this interpretation. The historical Attila did actually have his brother, Bleda, killed in order to have the sole rule. ~<The treasure~>: Sigurth's hoard, which Atli claimed as the brother of Brynhild and husband of Guthrun, Sigurth's widow, but which Gunnar and Hogni kept for themselves, with, as Atli here charges, Guthrun's connivance. ~<My mother~>: the only other reference to Atli's mother is in ~<Oddrunargratr~>, 30, wherein she appears as the adder who stings Gunnar to death, and in the prose passages based on that stanza.]",

The Volsungasaga paraphrase of line 2 is so remote as to be puzzling: \"It was little to bear the name of widow.\" Perhaps, however, the word \"not\" fell out between \"was\" and \"little.\"\n\n95. ~<Thing~>, etc.: here the poet makes Atli into a typical Norse land-owner, going to the \"Thing,\" or general law council, to settle his disputes. Even the compilers of the ~<Volsungasaga~> could not accept this, and in their paraphrase changed \"Thing\" to \"battle.\" The text of the second half of line 2 is uncertain.
